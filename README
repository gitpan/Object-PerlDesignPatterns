Object/PerlDesignPatterns version 0.01
======================================

PerlDesignPatterns is a free on-line book, forum, and GNU-Savanna project at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/perlpatbook/ .  
This is a collaborative work in progress.

PerlDesignPatterns is...

* Snapshot of an open-access project
* Subject to constant change
* Perl-centric
* Not an executable module
* Not a finished product
* Not well tested
* Not pretty
* Not proofread or spell checked
* Not official
* Not complete

This book is full of tricks for old pros and novices a like.

Experts and aspiring experts: 
SkipTheIntroduction is the best places to start browsing, or start at "Object 
Adapter Design Patterns" and work down.

Novices, intermediate programmers: 
The "Object Nuts and Bolts" section is for you. 

An HTML version is included. Due to the rough state of the POD output, this
is the prefered method of viewing this document.

You are encouraged to use the Wiki. Go ahead and add your comment

See WhyWikiWorks for more infromation.

PerlPatternsToDo - a list of things I personally need to still do.

The POD likely contains numerous errors.
It was not reviwed or endorced by the community.
Well known patterns and refactorings are missing.
