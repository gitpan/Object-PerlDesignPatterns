<br><br> <a name="AboutQuality"><h2>AboutQuality</h2><br> <br><br>
<i>One question that can't be answered from the sample code laying around in most books is [...] GOOD design.</i> <br><br>
The Linux kernel's design goals are stability, speed, and understandability, in  that order. Microsoft aims for ease of use and tight integration. Dealing with  multiple developers and turn over demands that software be modular. All of  these things are elements of quality. <br><br>
Speed, understandability, modularity, stability, and robustness are elements of  software quality. It doesn't make sense for every program to have every bit of  polish - nor is it possible. Perl really shines for rapid prototyping, so asking  that every single Perl program be fast and scalable is missing the spirit of  Perl. A quality Perl program to be one that makes intelligent design tradeoffs. <br><br>
Software quality decomposes many ways. Expending little effort demonstrates  mastery and gives an elegant solution. Software that withstands the test of  time has continued and educational value: the principles it is based on are  enduring -- not the fad of the week. Writing software that can easily be used  by other programmers is better than software that no one understands. What you  do and don't do in attempting to make your program better should reflect your  goals, your values, your ideals. Often it will reflect your weakness - as you're  intentionally trying to sound out a concept you haven't completely grasped.  Putting ideas into code is a wonderful way to challenge yourself to develop  deeper understanding. Chapter 1 XXX takes a look at software quality, in particular. <br><br>
<i>...from the start, Perl has never really been satisfied with staying in any one particular ecological niche. Thats not [a] terribly healthy approach in evolutionary terms, especially when your niche goes away. Perl's been pretty lucky so far to land in stable niches, but if some of its current niches dry up someday, that's really only to be expected, and indeed almost hoped for. It's probably the fault of closing ecological niches that we aren't all still swinging from trees, after all.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LarryWall">LarryWall</a> <br><br>
More and more large applications are being written in Perl. Meerkat, Webmin, and  Faq-O-Matic are web-side examples. Major firms from electronics, banking,  financial and other industries implement corporate infrastructure and business  logic in Perl. In 2000, the United States Department of Commerce used Perl to  tally census data. Perl was integral to the Human Genome project. Because of  the (often correctly) perceived low quality of Perl code, Perl applications  tend to hide from the lime light. To get Perl used in high visibility places,  knowing how to write world class code is key. Perl is a non-intrusive language -  design principles that apply to large systems don't have anything to do with  small ones. Perl doesn't know what you're writing so it enforces nothing. <br><br>
<i>But more to the point, why is software so bad? Programming is sometimes compared to an engineering specialty and the point is made that product standards are much lower for software. Software, unlike building construction, for example, is pure design. The actual programming phase is just a finer grained version of what we programmers normally call "design". </i> -  Ray Yeargin on Librenix.com <br><br>
Practice and reflection will make your software great. Learning is a very  personal thing and demands the right answer be given at the right time, in pace  with the student. The most important chapter in any technical book is the index.  This book will take the format of an art appreciation course. If we learn how  to write good software, it'll be through example, not instruction. This text isn't  finished: I have a lot of instruction I still need to remove, and a lot of examples I need to add. <br><br>
<br><br> <a name="AboutPerl"><h2>AboutPerl</h2><br> <br><br>
Because we don't know how programs will reinvent themselves, we don't know how  to design an "Interface"  <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a> ,  what composite types are involved, and what containment and inheritance hierarchies will look like. In the beginning, we seldom know that a program will grow into this at all! <br><br>
Perl's easy going attitude and powerful features shine here. After a program  has devised a solution to a logic problem, and after it has proved its  continued usefulness, we have a route for improvement. <br><br>
<br><br> <a name="AboutObjects"><h2>AboutObjects</h2><br> <br><br>
<i>That's about all there is to it. Now you need just to go off and buy a book about object-oriented design methodology, and bang your forehead with it for the next six months or so.</i> - perlobj man page <br><br>
"Objects" allow arbitrary arrangements of useful logic. This enables software  to scale, exhibit flexibility within its development cycle, and within the life on a single invocation. Implementations of different facilities can be swapped  out not only during development, but while the program is running. <br><br>
Objects don't help you finish a boring program quicker. They don't help much  with diddling with a bit of code until it works. They don't magically make your programs maintainable and extensible.  <br><br>
Many Perl programmers happily blast OO. I believe every idea has its time and  place. Clearly, small scripts aren't the place for OO, and before the code is  even working isn't the time. Knowing when and how to use OO means knowing how  to benefit from it without it getting in the way. <br><br>
Conventional wisdom says that you can't graft objects onto an existing design.  Perhaps you're already a Perl fan because it lets you break rules. This is one  that needs breaking. In Perl, you can indeed bless <a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> an existing datastructure into object-hood.  <br><br>
Graphical User Interfaces <a href="#footnote3">[3]</a> proved the value of Object Oriented programming: see <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PerlPaint">PerlPaint</a>.  Everything that gets drawn on your screen shares are few similarity: it has an appearance that only it knows how to draw. It can inside of another object, such as menus can be in title bars and buttons can be in windows. It can send messages when activated to other objects which control the behavior of the application. Versions of components customized for appearance or behavior could easily be created, extending existing code.  Taking advantage of these similarities  allowed graphical elements to be mixed and matched, and allowed the application to  treat similar elements in the same way. It also allowed complex structures to be arranged at run time and continiously revised as the user moved things around on the screen and opened windows. The possibilities are built in rather than the limits. The gospel spilled out. Large applications and operating systems adopted the tenets.   Web programming adopted it after a rash of horrible overgrown "scripts" mostly written by Perl programmers.  <br><br>
Software Engineering has traditionally meant applying the right algorithm for  the job. Most University educations focus on understanding algorithms. This is  important, and <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AdvancedAlgorithmsInPerl">AdvancedAlgorithmsInPerl</a>, O'Reilly Press, is good reading on the topc.  Attention to the overall structure of the program, how the algorithms fit  together, and building software with (at least the appearance of) a grand  design is the trendy new wave. <br><br>
With this in mind, lets think of Objects as tools, just like any other Perl  shortcut or magic. Remember - There is More Than One Way To Do It. <br><br>
Back to <a href="#PerlDesignPatterns">PerlDesignPatterns</a> <br><br>
<br><br> <a name="AboutPatterns"><h2>AboutPatterns</h2><br> <br><br>
Too many <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> programming books tell you what an "OO" program looks  like, and all of the benefits you'll receive from writing code in this style.  The result has been large amounts of code that use OO features, but miss the  boat on profiting from them. Since we're using them strictly for fun and  profit, we're going to concentrate on the exact utility of each idea, and when  it is useful to apply it. <br><br>
"DesignPatterns" explain how real software problems map into the facilities of  Object systems. Patterns give us symptoms to watch for that tip you off that  they may be a much better way. They are parables of good software design. <br><br>
"DesignPatternsElementsOfReusableSoftwareComponents" brought  <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DesignPatterns">DesignPatterns</a> to computer science. When it did, it talked about OO constructs  exclusively. Since Perl programs combine many other ideas,  we're going to  extend the concept. Objects are data attached to code; "LambdaClosures" are  code attached to data. "Exporting" lets one module alter the world of another.  Usually this means adding keywords, but there are few limits. Perl's  introspective, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DynamicLanguage">DynamicLanguage</a> capabilities open up a new area of investigation.  Perl is multi-paradigmatic, and we should be too. <br><br>
XXX <i>I apologize for the length of this letter, for I lacked the time to make it shorter.</i> -- Blaise Pascal  <br><br>
Are Design Patterns worth it? Programmers freshly exposed to Design Patterns  start building Winchester mansions <a href="#footnote4">[4]</a> The creations themselves could likewise said be garish curiosities, Victorian  in their own right. The same disease has been noted in programmers first  exposed to the lambda programming style of Scheme and programmers first exposed to Object Oriented programming. Creatively applying Object Orientation to a  problem quickly degenerates into creatively making everything an object. Soon  every variable, operator, condition, state, state transition, record, and  connection is an object. Don't laugh. I've read serious texts that have turned  state transitions into objects <a href="#footnote5">[5]</a>.  I can see the utility for this - in a case  where complex many-to-many relationships existed between state transitions and  other parts of the program. There is a difference between building an  abstraction and abstract building. I'd have to answer the question "no" for  most programmers: Design Patterns aren't worth it. On the other hand, most  programmers don't program Perl. Perl programmers already have well-ventilated  feet. To me, reading Object Oriented code is often like reading Atari BASIC  (or any other non-procedural BASIC, for that matter). Finding out where values  come from is a riddle. Names of objects and constructor prototypes give hints  about how things are arranged, which let you wager a guess about where it  probably should come from, which is sometimes where they do come from.  The code is a web, and values tend to travel pretty darn far across it. On the  other hand, in BASIC, important constants are near the top. I think BASIC wins  this one. BASIC programs were proud of their constants: the fact that they were  made into variables instead of repeated hardcodes, and placed at the top of the  file, let them proudly display them as the easy to change options they are. In  OO programming style, something is either adjusted with a GUI preferences  screen, or its a shameful bit of post-war relic. The bad news is in order to be  cleansed of all sin in this nihilist religion, you need an infinite number of  config screens to keep up with the growing number of options of the growing  program: there is no upper bound and no end to this race.  <a href="#footnote6">[6]</a>.  At some point,  things break down, and some foundation must be hardcoded, somewhere. The gentle art of  bootstrapping, non GUI editable config files, and compile-time preferences have  an enduring place in software. Likewise, the breaks need to be put on OO. Perl  programs haven't reached this level of garishness yet. Perl is a humble  language, as <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LarryWall">LarryWall</a> says, so with some ties to our roots, perspective, and  frequent trips to the confessional, it may never become garish. Lets hope.  Systems of Object relationships should never create more complexity than they  clear up. This is an important and powerful motive to stop OO-ifying a program  at a certain point. OO-ifying a program should make the program shorter, more  readable, easier to prototype, cleaner, more robust - everything that OO zealots  promised. If it doesn't it isn't a fault of OO or the OO zealots, its your  fault - you've gone too far. <br><br>
An important tip of the hat to <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MarkJasonDominus">MarkJasonDominus</a> goes here. His "'Design  Patterns' Aren't" lightning talk voiced some latent objections I couldn't quite  formulate. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ChristopherAlexander">ChristopherAlexander</a>, author of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PatternLanguage">PatternLanguage</a>,  conceived of design patterns for architecture. His book doesn't tell you what  to build, nor how to build it. To quote M. J. Dominus,  //The problem Alexander is trying to solve is: How can you distribute  responsibility for design through all levels of a large hierarchy, while still  maintaining consistency and harmony of overall design?// Convention and  communication are key, especially since convention in Perl is purely voluntary.  Alexander's book is concerned with the level immediately above and immediately  below yours, in addition to what you're doing. To think of space being  distributed not only according to boundaries but according to delegation and  impact is novel. When designing a city, planning for neighborhoods, public t ransportation, and intertwined natural areas are smaller scale architectural  elements. When designing a school, park, or housing community, they are larger,  encompassing architectural elements. Designing a nice whatever is important,  but fitting it into the surrounding picture, at the same time thinking of the  people who will pick up your work where you leave it, is paramount. This cuts  deeper to the heart of encapsulation and delegation than any single programming  technique. <br><br>
<i>Architecture is often seen as a luxury or a frill, or the indulgent pursuit of lily-gilding compulsives who have no concern for the bottom line.</i> -- Pattern Language of Program Design IV <br><br>
Architects know how to design skylights, and they delegate the actual construction  of architectural objects to qualified builders. The primary job of the a rchitect is a creative one: designing something functional that uses standard  elements to create custom solutions for unanticipated specifications. This is  remarkably similar to the plight of the programmer, baring one difference:  programmers have to do the construction themselves. Being bogged down in this  labor-intensive discipline can suck time away from contemplating the bigger  picture. The mention of a skylight makes an architect giddy as he visualizes  the light playing across the open spaces. The mention of a skylight makes a  builder sigh as he ponders reinforcing the roof, hanging drywall in the roof,  and more trim work. Not only can being bogged down in this level of detail keep  programmers from appreciating architectural elements of software, it can keep  them from learning about them at all. If that isn't enough, only recently was  any effort made to catalog them. To top it all off, clients don't ask for  architecturally sound software: they ask for huge amounts of square footage  decorated with endless amounts of cheap facade. Design is cast away as an  inconvenient nuisance that limits how much software can be churned out how fast.  Architects are judged by the quality of their work. Programmers are judged by  the quantity of their work. <br><br>
Architects design stable structures, but they also creatively ply their craft  to devise ways to make their customers value the structure more. The structures  that pass the test of time are not only the most solid ones, but the most  innovative, imaginative, inspirational, and useful. <br><br>
That being said, its important to decide what to build, and how to build it, on  your own. It is also important to know what is available to build, and the  techniques available to do so. Being the designer-constructor, you have to pay  your own price for your design errors. <br><br>
<i>Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?JoelOnSoftware">JoelOnSoftware</a> <br><br>
<br><br> <a name="SoftwareQualityLevels"><h2>SoftwareQualityLevels</h2><br> <br><br>
1. Works when no one is watching <br><br>
When the requirements are completely out of control, many programmers celebrate even having reached this point. <br><br>
2. Works if you do it just right <br><br>
Too many applications, most not written in Perl, make it to this point and stop cold. Forget reusable, this isn't even usable. <br><br>
3. Trying most things once, it doesn't break <br><br>
You may be tempted to give a software demo in front of a crowded auditorium at this point. Don't. <br><br>
4. Other people tried it, and it seems to work <br><br>
Software released to the community often starts at this point. Before this point, there isn't enough benefit for it to be worthwhile for them to fix your bugs. <br><br>
5. Been in production for a while, and you're running out of bugs to fix <br><br>
Most perl programs quickly shot to level 5, and stop. Level 5 is a good level. Since its really about the users, not the developers, Perl has traditionally been great for end users. <br><br>
6. Other programmers are adding to it, so you made the code understandable <br><br>
Other programs can incorporate this program into theirs, or vice versa, and benefit from your work. <br><br>
7. A lot of people are working on it, so you made it modular and well laid out logically <br><br>
Resistant to damage caused by new features, different requires, and new programmers. In a lot of ways, like a Spider Plant: fractal, prolific, and cute. <br><br>
8. It has turned into a generic framework for doing things of this kind, and has been separated from early assumption <br><br>
Different products that do the same thing but better are different, but are based on this class, can easily be created. <br><br>
9. Hoards of the nit-pickiest people on the net have picked every last nit out of it <br><br>
College classes are dedicated to exploring your code. Aspiring programmers marvel at the sheer beauty of it. <br><br>
Most programmers are smart and hard working. Things go wrong mysteriously.  Changing requirements stress the design of a program. A program at level 5 can  quickly turn into a level 2 program, if people start working on it who don't  understand the entire design, or the original design doesn't take into account  the direction it takes into the future and no one adapts the design. This is  the primary reason to shoot for a level 7 program. Having net-god status thrust  upon you and having to live up to it, or attempting to attain net-god status  is the primary reason to shoot for level 9. Of course, if the program is a few  lines long, none of this amounts to a hill of beans. <br><br>
<i>Software does not wear out in the traditional sense of machinery with moving </i> <i>parts.

<i>Eventually you wind up with libraries that are more trouble to reuse than rewrite from scratch</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOrientedDesignHeuristics">ObjectOrientedDesignHeuristics</a>. <br><br>
OO isn't real, in the sense that it's an idea. There are seldom litmus tests  for presence of ideas. It isn't a feature of a language that makes your program  better. Instead, it is a collection of ideas, and facilities in the language,  to apply these ideas. I won't ever discuss wither or not a language is an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> language. Early C++ compilers compiled C++ down to C and fed it to a C  compiler. This doesn't make C++ any less OO. In fact, no matter what the  language and its basic premises, they all run on the same computers and compile  down to the same languages that computer processors can understand.  <br><br>
As with anything that is built up too much, results fall short of expectations.  While many people are avid believers in OO, others are quick to point out cases  where it does more harm than good. Before we do anything else, lets look at  exactly what OO is, and what it isn't. A good, hard, honest evaluation will  set reasonable expectations. Reasonable expectations will keep everyone happy. <br><br>
<li> ObjectOrientated<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOrientated">+</a> Programming is Anal <br><br>

<li> <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> Programming is Verbose <br><br>
It needn't be. Perl is an idiotmatic language and shouldn't change to suit OO's style. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?IdiomaticProgramming">IdiomaticProgramming</a>. <br><br>

<i>We begin with the part of the language which defines a town or a community. These patterns can never be "designed" or "built" in one fell swoop - but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it.</i> - A <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PatternLanguage">PatternLanguage</a> <br><br>
NP Complete problems take an exponential, relative to the amount of input, to complete. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MasteringAlgorithmsWithPerl">MasteringAlgorithmsWithPerl</a>. <br><br>
Contrived interfaces result from arrogantly believing that every aspect of the  design of the program can be anticipated. This is akin to playing out a game of chess without touching a piece. All of the decision making in the world do a bit  of good if it doesn't take reality into account, and reality requires constant  probing to understand. <br><br>
<i>Every program can be reduced by one instruction, and every program has at least one bug. Therefore, any program can be reduced to one instruction which doesn't work.</i> -- Unknown XXX <br><br>
OO has been marketed as making planning easy. Planning without feedback is easy  but useless. Planning with hypothetical feedback is both difficult and useless.  I propose that planning to make design changes is far more important than any  other planning you will do. Knowing when and how to restructure code applies  equally to procedural and OO code. OO discipline only helps make the process  easier. <br><br>
<i>No feedback means no quality in what you do.  A project without a prototype is like a candle without a wick.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PeterMerel">PeterMerel</a> <br><br>
No feedback means no opportunity for improvement. Old timers blame the  disappearance of punch cards for the deterioration in software quality <a href="#footnote7">[7]</a>.  Using punch cards forces you to stop and think things through. Interactive  programming lets you guess your way through, often never really understanding  the situation. A language that makes you be explicit about your intentions in  great detail is a throw back to punch cards, in a way. Guessing has its place  in sounding out theories (and passing exams). Having a compiler that can give  you critical feedback may be a good trade off. Not having a product means no  feedback - no feedback from the compiler, or from sounding out the design.  <br><br>
The only constant is change. <br><br>
<i>An assault on large problems employs a succession of programs, most of which spring into existence en route. These programs are rife with issues that appear to be particular to the problem at hand.</i> -- Alan J.

Good design comes from bad design eventually, if you learn from your mistakes.  This may be the only software engineering manual that desn't beg and plead with  you to "do it right the first time". You have to pick your battles though: for  any program, some problems are design flaws, some are design trade-offs. How do you "fix" a trade off? <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="AggregatePattern"><h2>AggregatePattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Members of a common subclass are each known to have certain methods. These methods return information about the state of that perticular object. It does happen that an application is concerned with an aggregation, or amalgamation, of data from several object of the same type. This leads to code being repeated around the program: <br><br>
<pre>
  my $subtotal;
  foreach my $item (@cart) {
    $subtotal += $item->query_price();
  }

  my $weight;
  foreach my $item (@cart) {
    $weight += $item->query_weight();
  }

  # and so on

</pre>
Representing individual objects when the application is concerned about the general state of several objects is an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImpedenceMismatch">ImpedenceMismatch</a>. This is a common mismatch as programmers feel obligated to model the world in minute detail then are pressed with the problem of giving it all a high level interface.  <br><br>
Creat an object as a wrapper, using the same API, with a common subtype as a cart entry, but allow it to hold other objects of that subtype: make it a container. Define its accessors to return aggregate information on the objects it contains. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Cart/">Cart</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Cart::Basket">Basket</a>;

  @ISA = qw(Cart::Item);

  sub query_price {
    my $self = shift;
    my $contents = $self->{contents};
    foreach my $item (@$contents) {
    }
  }

  # other query_ routines here...

  sub add_item {
    my $self = shift;
    my $contents = $self->{contents};
    my $item = shift; $item->isa('Cart::Item') or die;
    push @$contents, $item;
    return 1;
  }

</pre>
The aggregation logic, in this case, totalling, need only exist in this container, rather than being strewn around the entire program. Less code, less <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?CodeMomentum">CodeMomentum</a>, fewer depencies, more flexibility. <br><br>
We have an object of base type <i>Cart::Item</i> that itself holds other <i>Cart::Item</i> objects. That makes us recursive and nestable - one basket could hold several items along with another basket, into which other items and baskets could be placed. You may or may not want to do this intentionally, but to someone casually calling <i>->query_price()</i> on your <i>Cart::Basket</i> object won't have to concern himself with this - things will just work. <br><br>

<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TheJoyOfPatterns">TheJoyOfPatterns</a> used stacking burger toppings as an example. It's a good  example. Lets use taco toppings instead, so we aren't copying them too  blatantly. Lets imagine that there is a taco concession in a mall. We won't call  it a Mexican restaurant. That would be a stretch. Most of their tacos sit under a heat lamp, pre-made, waiting for someone to order the standard taco. A rash  of bowel disrupting bacteria outbreaks brought suspicion on the heat lamps, so  people began ordering tacos with and without all kinds of weird toppings in  attempt to foil the pre-making efforts and get a fresh taco. The concessions  stand found that the cashiers were making a lot of errors adding up the costs  of the toppings, so they complained to the corporate office. Corporate office  searches the web for "a programmer that doesn't interview like they are reading from a script and who doesn't design patterns using taco toppings like the last guy", and hires the first person that comes up: a Perl programmer! <a href="#footnote8">[8]</a>. <br><br>
This programmer could write something like: <br><br>

To do it this way, they would have to create a class for each and every  topping, as well as each and every combination of toppings! With two toppings  this isn't out of hand. With 8 toppings, you've got 256 possible combinations.  With 12 toppings, you've 4096 combinations. Creating a permanent inheritance is the root of the problem, here. If we could do something similar, but on the  fly, we wouldn't need to write out all of the possible combinations in advance. We could also make the inheritance chain deeper and deeper as we needed to. <br><br>

The astute reader will notice that this isn't much more than a linked list.  Since inheritance is now dynamic, we've gotten rid of needing to explicit  create each combination of toppings. We use inheritance and a recursive  query_price() method that calls its parent's version of the method. When we add a topping, we tell it to inherit it from the last topping (possibly the base  taco). When someone calls query_price() on the taco, we pass off the request to our first topping. That topping passes it on down the line, adding them up as  it goes. <br><br>
There are two gotchas here, though. What if we want a taco with extra, extra  tomatos? <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Topping/">Topping</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Topping::Tomato">Tomato</a> would be told to inherit itself. This would create an  endless loop! All tomatos would have tomatos are their parent, not just the  last one added. Base taco would be forgotten about. The real problem here is  that we're modifying the whole class - not just the particular instance of the  tomato we added last. This would keep us from using a multithreaded cash  register shared by two people, and it would keep us from having two taco orders on the same tab, each with different toppings. Dynamic inheritance is a cool  trick, but you must remember that its effects are global. Reserve it for  creating objects of a new, unique name, of user specification, and perhaps a  few similar applications. <br><br>
For our purposes, though, this won't fly. The linked list approach is the right approach. However, we need to instantiate individual toppings, so that they  each have private data. In this private data, we need to store the  relationship: what the topping is topping is an attribute of each topping. <br><br>

There! We finally have something that passes as workable! This solution is good for something where we want to change arbitrary features of the object without  the containing object (in this case, taco) knowing before hand. We don't make  use this strength in this example. Since the query_price() method of the taco  object just passes the request right along, we can do any math we want. We  would be using this strength if we had a two-for-taco-toppings-Tuesday, where  all toppings were half price on Tuesdays. With a press of a button, a new  object could be pushed onto the front of the list that defined a price method  just returned half of whatever the price_method() in the next object returns.  The important thing to note is that we can stack logic by inserting one object  in front of another when "has-a" relationships. <br><br>

Problem: Objects talk to each other using an interface that has been overburdoned with the needs of security, access coherence, or historic versions of the interface. <br><br>
Solution: Move access-centric features of the interface into a Proxy object. Put it in charge of security, or implement the translation between the historic interface there, or use it to inforce access coherency. <br><br>
The Proxy Object is the grand daddy of all encapsulation patterns due to its  sheer lack of scope. Any other delegation pattern is just a special case of this general case. The Problem/Solution lines list some possible uses, but they could just as well be phrased "one objects demands too  much of another - have the second handle some of the work and delegate the rest".  <br><br>
A Proxy inherits the same base class or interface as the object it contains.  It can be a generic proxy, that wraps arbitrary objects, or it could be custom  crafted to stand in for a certain class. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?GenericProxy">GenericProxy</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $this = { };
    my $obj = shift; ref $obj or die;
    $this->{'obj'} = $obj;
    $type .= '::' . ref $obj;
    # copy inheritance info.
    @{ref($this).'::ISA'} = @{ref($obj).'::ISA'};
    bless $this, $type;
  }

  # bug XXX - autoload is only used after @ISA is searched!

  sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $this = shift;
    (my $methodName) = $AUTOLOAD m/.*::(\w+)$/;
    return if $methodName eq 'DESTROY';
    $this->{'obj'}->$methodName(@_);
  }

</pre>
This simple idea has many uses:  <br><br>
<li> Data Replicator - store or transmit information from "set_" methods. <li> Logger - for debugging purposes, record all access to the encapsulated object. <li> Cache - similar to Memoizing. Record each result and return it directly without recomputing it if it is ever requested again. <br><br>
Other ideas, such as the <a href="#FacadePattern">FacadePattern</a>, are based on this. This Pattern supports the idea of encapsulation. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="AdapterPattern"><h2>AdapterPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem:  You have code that will work with one kind of object, but there is another kind of object that should be able to be used in its place, that should work, but  doesn't. Two Interfaces are incompatible implementations of the same idea.  Using vender products interchangeably.  You have an object that requires one kind of object, when it should accept several different kinds.  You have one object that requires a certain type of object. You have another object that provides an interface. You want to use them together.  You could subclass one of the objects, but you'd loose polymorphism, unless all  subclasses and compatible objects were subclassed individually as well.  Instead, you make a generic container that is accepted by any of the first class, and contains anything derived from the second class, which translates between the two disparate interfaces.  <br><br>
Solution: Translate one interface to the other using a dedicated Adapter object. <br><br>
The Adapter is a case of the <a href="#ProxyPattern">ProxyPattern</a>. It isn't even a special case. You could call it an example of a Proxy. <br><br>
<li> Sometimes you have an object you want to use in place of another. <li> However, it has a different API. <li> An Adapter is a wedge between the object and the world grafting another interface onto it. <br><br>
I can't think of an example that doesnt' insult the intelligence. I'll have to look for one in the wild. <br><br>
XXX Discussion  <br><br>
XXX Code <br><br>
<a href="#InnerClasses">InnerClasses</a> are often used as Adapters. In Java, there is no way to pass a closure, a subroutine pointer, or any other first class object other than an actual object. Java 1.0 required you to create a class for each and every <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?CallBack">CallBack</a> you needed.  <a href="#footnote9">[9]</a> This was clearly unworkable. Java 1.1 eased the matter by allowing these objects to be defined with a short hand syntax, and allowed the definition to be placed in your code right where they  are passed. See <a href="#InnerClasses">InnerClasses</a> for more information. <br><br>

Problem:  A class is unwieldy to use. You don't want to be tied to that  interface or implementation. Your code is becoming closely tied to a class that you don't like, or you spend a lot of time dealing with a difficult interface, or several programmers on  your team have to learn a complex subject to accomplish a few simple tasks. <br><br>
Solution: Write a new interface to it that translates between your simple  requests and perhaps automates tedious things you do frequently.  <br><br>
Normally, you write for the interface of the class that you're using today, and if you have to use a different class tomorrow, you write a Proxy. With a poor  or overly complex interface, you may wind up writing for a complex interface,  then writing a Proxy to translate that back to a simple interface. A Facade is  a neutral ground. It allows you to shuff all of the related undesired  complexity should you switch classes. You can replace it with a new Facade that translates the simple interface of the first facade to the simple interface of  the replacement class.  <br><br>
A <a href="#DecoratorPattern">DecoratorPattern</a> adds complexity to the class it stands in for; a <a href="#FacadePattern">FacadePattern</a> mitigates complexity. Both are cases of the <a href="#ProxyPattern">ProxyPattern</a>. <br><br>
Conceivably, you could replace one package with a horrible interface with  another package with a horrible interface. In this case, you would need to  stick in an equally complex Facade, but the code using the interface could  remain blissfully ignorant of the whole ordeal. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ResultObject"><h2>ResultObject</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Polymorphic objects (interchangeable objects) pass sets of information to each other and return it back to each other. When passed in array form, it is difficult to add or remove arguments, and optional arguments require unsightly placeholders.  <br><br>
Solution: Rather than maintain the method calls and returns in all of the  calling and callee objects, you put the results in a new, intermediate object  type.  <br><br>
When you rename, insert, or delete a passed or returned parameter, you have to  change dozens of objects. <br><br>
Using an intermediate object to hold the results lets you add fields without  breaking code anywhere. Deleting or changing a member of the result only  affects places actually using that property, and opens the possibility of  backwards compatibility catering to accesses to the old field. Contrast this to the horror of positional arguments in a method call: <br><br>
<pre>
  $foo->do($arg, $str, $bleah, $blurgh);

</pre>
Should the arguments <i>do()</i> accepts be changed, every place it is called  would need to be changed as well to be consistent. Failure to do so results in no warning and erratic bugs. <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a> helps, but this is still no compile time check - missing an a call can lead a program killing bug. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="VisitorPattern"><h2>VisitorPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: The operations that can be performed on a type of object is poorly  defined, and always changing. Objects contain large numbers of unrelated methods that perform some sort of logic. <br><br>
Solution:  Instead of continuously  revising the objects themselves, put the logic is put into interchangeable  (polymorphic) Visitor objects. Use a fixed interface between the objects containing data and the objects defining the behavior. <br><br>
Data is contained in objects of a certain class or subclass. Many  operations can be performed on objects of this class.  <br><br>
The actual operation to be done becomes pluggable. This fits with putting code  where it belongs.  Infocom, famous for its text adventure games with extremely intelligent natural language parsers, used a permutation of this idea. Any action you wished to  perform was stated as a sentence. The parser picked out the verb, direct  object, and indirect object. In three rounds, the verb was invoked, then the  direct object, then the indirect object. The first round, each object was given  a chance to veto the action: perhaps the verb object checked to see if the  environment was tagged as being underwater, or the direct object may know for a fact that the material it is made out of is non-flammable, or the indirect  object may be a torch that isn't currently lit, and vetos the action because it knows it isn't lit. If not vetoed, this is repeated for a round where changes  actually take affect and objects update their state, then for a final round  where each object reports on the consequence of the action. In this case, a  container object holding information about the sentence, is acted upon by three pluggable objects: the verbs Visitor, the direct objects Visitor, and the  indirect objects Visitor. Another example would be a pourage container acted  upon by three different bear Visitors objects. <br><br>
<a href="#footnote11">[11]</a> <br><br>
Use different objects logic to work on our data. As Perl gives us dynamic inheritance, adding and removing objects from our @ISA  array could have the same effect. We simply inherit the object that accesses  our data the way we want, when we want. When methods defined in the Visitor  object are called, they are presented with all of our data, saving the bother  of querying each item individually. This still requires a clean, well defined  interface: which methods need to be defined, and how the data is represented.  This approach rules out making changes to how we store the data and maintaining compatibility through the interface, as a disadvantage. <br><br>
The Visitor name emphasises that the objects implementing behavior and the object containing data have no real relationship with each other: neither holds on to a reference to the other. They are merely interchangeable parts, to be here today and gone tomorrow. <br><br>
Barrowing from the <a href="http://patternsinperl.com/designpatterns/visitor/">http://patternsinperl.com/designpatterns/visitor/</a> example by <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?NigelWetters">NigelWetters</a>, data items are coerced into a common superclass. This isn't object clean. It is always better to fix problems at the source rather than lurk in wait wielding band-aids <a href="#footnote12">[12]</a>. The example does serve to illustrate that data items should be of a common base type to be accepting as a Visitor.  <br><br>
<pre>
  foreach my $class ( qw(NAME SYNOPSIS CODE) ) {
          no strict 'refs';
          push @{ "POD::${class}::ISA" }, "POD::POD";
  }

</pre>
Not having to use a different method call in each behavior object is key. That would prvent us from using them interchangably. It would introduce need for hardcoded dependencies. We would no longer be able to easily add new behavior objects. Assuming that each behavior object has exactly one method, each method should have the same name. Something generic like <i>->go()</i> is okey, I suppose. Naming it after the data type it operators on makes more sense, though. If there is a common theme to the behavior objects, abstract it out into the name. <i>->top_taco()</i> is a fine name. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Taco/">Taco</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Taco::Topper">Topper</a>;

  # and so on...


</pre>
Gravey? On a taco? Yuck! In real life, places in the mall that serve "tacos" also tend to serve fries, burgers, hotdogs, and other dubiously non-quasi-Mexican food. It doesn't make sense to have one vat of cheese for the nachos, another for tacos, and yet another for cheesy-gravey-fries. The topper should be able to apply cheese to any of them. Keep in mind that these behavior classes work on a general class of objects, not merely one object. A burger could be a subclass of a taco. See <a href="#StateVsClass">StateVsClass</a> for some thoughts on what makes a good subclass. <br><br>
The taco object could then do something vaguley along the lines of... <br><br>
<pre>
  $topping_counter->get_cheese_gun()->top_taco($self);

</pre>
... where <i>$topping_counter</i> holds our different topping guns, and <i>get_cheese_gun()</i> returns a cached instance of <i>Taco::Topper::Cheese</i>.  This creates a sort of a cow-milking-itself problem. The taco shouldn't be cheesing itself, some other third party should make the connection. Assuming that the topping counter has been robotized and humans enslaved by the taco craving robots, perhaps the topping counter could cheese the taco.  <a href="#footnote13">[13]</a>. <br><br>
<i>Taco::Topper</i>'s strange <i>die()</i> calls give a prime example of run time interface checking versus compile time interface checking. Perl does this run time, Java compile time. Since the Java compiler would catch either of those errors, no run time checks are needed - those <i>die()</i> calls could go away. Also, the program wouldn't need to be thoroughly tested to find out if those <i>die()</i> calls ever happen - once again, it would be cought at compile time.  <br><br>
The <a href="#VisitorPattern">VisitorPattern</a> is a special case of <a href="#FeatureEnvy">FeatureEnvy</a>: we're more concerned about another objects data than our own. This flies in the face of the first rule of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> programming: data and related code should be packaged together. <a href="#FeatureEnvy">FeatureEnvy</a> suggests that perhaps the code should just be moved into the object being tweaked. In this case, we've been there, didn't like it, and moved it, but abstracted it behind an interface. The alternatives would have been <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MixIns">MixIns</a> or something far worse. The first rule of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> programming is that anything is okey if its  hidden behind an interface. <br><br>
The important thing to remember is that we can cheese things as long as they provide an interface that allows cheesing. In this example, <i>query_flag()</i>, <i>set_flags()</i>, <i>query_price()</i>, and <i>add_price()</i>.  <br><br>

Problem:  Values from a definitive list of permissiable values are needed. In Perl, hashes of possible valid values are commonly used, and enums are used in C. These permissiable values must be packaged with their behavior  <a href="#footnote14">[14]</a>, or we're trying to apply to this idea in an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> way. Or, each object is a special <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MagicCookie">MagicCookie</a>: unique, impossible to recreate without being given it, and therefore later usable as proof of having been given the cookie. <br><br>
Solution:  Centralize creation, containment, and distribution of the objects. <br><br>
The container of the objects also plays the roles of both the creator and distributor. The creator aspect makes one of each when it itself is created, like the <a href="#SingletonPattern">SingletonPattern</a> applied to multiple objects. The distributor aspect descides to whom and on what basis the objects are distributed. <br><br>
The idea of <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a> allows us to validate that these objects probably came from our pool without having to have an explicit list of all of the members of the pool: <br><br>
<pre>
  # using <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a>:

  sub set_day {
    die unless $_[0]->isa('Day');
    $day = shift;
    return 1;
  }

  # using a plain old hash:

  sub set_day {
    die unless exists $daysref->$_[0];
    $day = shift;
    return 1;
  }

</pre>
Everything from this set passes the "isa" test, so we can use <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a> to check our arguments. In any other language, it would be impossible to add  to the set after being created this way, but we could do revisit the package (see <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?RevisitingNamespaces">RevisitingNamespaces</a>) or redefine the constructor in Perl, so this shouldn't be considered secure. <pre>

XXX examples of use, what you can and cannot do, etc. <br><br>
Java's API, AWT especially, has numerous examples of this. <i>AWT.Color</i> contains <i>AWT.Color.RED</i>,  <i>AWT.Color.BLUE</i>, and so forth. This provides a symbolic name for objects, where each object is unique. There will never be two different <i>BLUE</i> objects floating around. This allows us to compare them for equality using their pointers: <br><br>
<pre>
  $mon eq $mon;        # true
  $mon eq $tues;       # false

This behavior, too, is shared with the <a href="#SingletonPattern">SingletonPattern</a>. The same effect could be acheived using <a href="#OverloadOperators">OverloadOperators</a>. This approach is simplier and more clear. <br><br>
If we give someone <i>AWT.Color.BLUE</i>, and then they later give it back to us, we can use the <i>eq</i> test to decide with certainty whether or not we gave them <i>BLUE</i> as there is no other way they could possibly obtain it <a href="#footnote15">[15]</a>. <br><br>

Problem: Checks litter the code. Nearly every method checks one specific instance variable to decide how to behave. The  possible values of this variable are finite in number and well understood: on and off, or north, south, west, east, for example. <br><br>
Solution: Make each possible state of the object into a subclass. Leave the general case and the general logic in the parent object. Consider the state variable to be a constant in each subclass and optimize it away in your code.  <br><br>
What happens when a light switch is thrown depends on its current state: on or off. Its new state is the opposite. A light switch has to be capable of dealing with all of the complexities of being either on or off, which isn't a lot of complexity, really. However, some machines have dozens or hundreds of states. This one machine has to know how to be in each state. In reality, few machines serve a large number of purposes. Attempts have been made to combine cell phones and PDAs, cell phones and MP3 players, PDAs and MP3 players, MP3 players and portable storage devices, PDAs and portable storage devices, audio recorders and MP3 players, audio recorders and PDAs, audio recorders and cell phones... in thousands of combinations... there is not currently an example of all three of those things in one device. It is complex to have a pocket full of devices, but it also complex to  <s>license all of the patents needed to implement</s> design a device that serves every purpose. Design simplicity wins, for now.  Likewise, when implementing a complex virtual object, sometimes it is best to represent it as a collection of simple objects, each of which knows exactly what its purpose is and cares nothing for the purposes of the other objects, not even able to agree on a common flash media format. When you wish to switch from one mode of the object to another, you simply replace it with the other object. No complex internal state change occurs, just one broad over all state change. States are each clearly defined and seperate. <br><br>

Problem: Objects are left in an inconsistant state in a failure scenario. <br><br>
Solution: Checkpoint the object and restore it in the event of failure. <br><br>
Synopsis: You need an "Undo" behavior. Delegate an object to be the keeper of another. <br><br>
When: You are starting something you may not be able to finish. An operation might abort, leaving data in an inconsistent state. <br><br>
Symptoms: Querying values from an object and conditionally restoring them. <br><br>
XXX Generic example with a deep-copy algorithm. <br><br>
Easily implemented by wrapping one object inside of another and using Clone. <br><br>

While this is a generic Memento package, it cannot possibly know how to  correctly deal with objects contained inside the object given it. A version of  this (possibly subclassed) tailored to a specific package would handle this  situation correctly. Here, we replicate objects mercilessly. This code also  violates the encapsulation rules of OO. Use it as a starting point for  something that doesn't. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="SingletonPattern"><h2>SingletonPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: You're using a constructor to create an object, but the design considers it an error to create more than one instance of that class. Or, you have a single instance of an object now, but this is an implementation detail, subject to change. <a href="#PassingState">PassingState</a> says to create the resources as early as needed and  pass it to constructors, but you would be passing it almost everywhere.  <br><br>
Solution: Have your constructor, <i>new()</i>, return the same single object every time it is called. Allow objects to call the constructor directly. The Singleton will create the single instance of itself, and will be the repository for that single instance. <br><br>
Synopsis: You've found a very good reason to have exactly one of a certain class.  You rig the constructor to return the single existing instance instead of making a new one. <br><br>
When:  C2 <a href="#SingletonPattern">SingletonPattern</a> lists example valid uses as logging, network interaction,  and database connections.  <br><br>
Symptoms: Resource objects are created when the program starts and passed to the constructor of each object initially spawned. Each of those objects in turn pass this resource object to each of their children. <br><br>
<li> Most popular "Design Pattern" <li> Stems from deep seated paranoia. <li> Doesn't let anyone make more than exactly one of something. <li> Used as an excuse to hardcode object references around instead of taking them in the constructor. See <a href="#PassingPattern">PassingPattern</a>. <br><br>
Given a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MountRushmore">MountRushmore</a> object, you want to be sure that its the true, one and  only, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MountRushmore">MountRushmore</a>, and not someone's cheap knock-off.  <br><br>

Singletons are a special case of StaticObjects<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?StaticObjects">+</a>. <br><br>
<b>Don't Use Singletons When...</b> <br><br>
This is over used. Don't make too many assumptions about when two of  something could be handy. For example, the X-Windows windowing system early on  assumed that more than one display could be attached to a system. This pattern  should be used to distribute globally available resources. It should not be used to contain context or state information - this would make it impossible to create distinct instances of objects which use the singleton. Singletons should not be ValueObjects<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ValueObjects">+</a>. <br><br>
Since many programs have a proliferation of Singletons, it may be handy to  place all of them in a global Static Object, which itself is a Singleton.  <br><br>
Singletons managing a set of 1 or more objects for which there is contention or sharing is a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ResourcePool">ResourcePool</a>. <br><br>
When a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ValueObject">ValueObject</a> is wanted to hold configuration information, instead use <a href="#PassingPattern">PassingPattern</a>: this allows different instances of objects to be given different runtime parameters. Failure to do so would violate the identity requirement of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> programming, and we wouldn't want that, would we? <br><br>

<a href="#footnote16">[16]</a> <br><br>
This is based on <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a>, which is itself based on <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractClasses">AbstractClasses</a>, or the  concept of types it puts forward, rather. We confound the subject with  <a href="#AnonymousSubroutineObjects">AnonymousSubroutineObjects</a>. We use <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a>, <a href="#ClassAsTypeCode">ClassAsTypeCode</a> and <a href="#NewObjectFromExisting">NewObjectFromExisting</a>. <a href="#RunAndReturnSuccessor">RunAndReturnSuccessor</a> is a fundamental idea to the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosure">LambdaClosure</a> idea of currying, and we demonstrate it in the second example. <br><br>
Currying is a universe of single argument functions. This sounds absurd and useless, and would be except for the tenets of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosures">LambdaClosures</a>. This pattern develops when state is accumulated incrementatally: see <a href="#AccumulateAndFire">AccumulateAndFire</a>. <a href="#AccumulateAndFire">AccumulateAndFire</a> comes about when there are <a href="#TooManyArguments">TooManyArguments</a> to pass all at once. Attempting to pass them all at once loose us the flexibility of being able to set things up, run, change a few things, run, and so on. <br><br>
For example, lets say we're playing roulette. We can pick a color and  perhaps a few numbers. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Roulette/">Roulette</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Roulette::Table">Table</a>;

  sub new {

    my $class = shift;
    my $this;

    # if new() is called on an existing object, we're providing additional
    # constructors, not creating a new object

    if(ref $class) {
      $this = $class;
    } else {
      bless $this, $class;
    }

    # read any number of and supported type of arguments

    foreach my $arg (@_) {
      if($arg->isa('Roulette::Color')) {
        $this->{'color'} = $arg;
      } elsif($arg->isa('Roulette::Number')) {
        my $numbers = $this->{'numbers'};
        push @$numbers, $arg;
      } elsif($arg->isa('Money')) {
        if($this->{'money'}) {
          $this->{'money'}->combine($arg);
        } else {
          $this->{'money'} = $arg;
        }
      }
    }

    return $this;

  }

  sub set_color { new(@_); }
  sub add_number { new(@_); }
  sub add_wager { new(@_); }

</pre>
The constructor, <i>new()</i>, accepts any number or sort of object of the kinds that it knows about, and skuttles them off to the correct slot in the object. Our <i>set</i> routines are merely aliases for <i>new()</i>. <i>new()</i> may be called multiple times, directly or indirectly, to spread our wager over more numbers, change which color we're betting on, or plunk down more cash. I don't play roulette - I've probably butched the example. Feel free to correct it. Use the little <i>edit</i> link. People won't be doing everything for you your entire life, atleast I hope. <br><br>
We still have the problem of having an object exist in an indeterminate state. If we apply <a href="#AnonymousSubroutineObjects">AnonymousSubroutineObjects</a>, we get something much closer to the original idea of currying. Rather than storing state in an object as it is built up, store it in a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosure">LambdaClosure</a> that is object aware: <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Roulette/">Roulette</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Roulette::Table">Table</a>;

  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a>;

  sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $this;
    my $curry;

    bless $this, $class;
    
    $curry = <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a> sub {

        my $msg = shift;

        if($msg eq 'spin_wheel') {
          die "Inconsistent state: not all arguments have been specified";
        }

        if($msg eq 'set_color') {
          $this->{'color'} = shift;
        } 

        if($msg eq 'add_number') {
          $this->{'numbers'} ||= [];
          my $numbers = $this->{'numbers'};
          push @$numbers, $arg;
        }

        if($msg eq 'add_add_money') {
          if($this->{'money'}) {
            $this->{'money'}->combine($arg);
          } else {
            $this->{'money'} = $arg;
          }
        }

        if($msg eq 'is_ready') {
          return 0;
        }

        if($this->{'money'} and $this->{'color'} and $this->{'numbers'}) {
          return $this;
        } else {
          return $curry;
        }
        
    };

    return $curry;

  }

  sub spin_wheel {
    # logic here...
  }

  sub is_ready {
    return 1;
  }

</pre>
This second example doesn't support repeated invocations of <i>new()</i> to further define an unfinished object. It could, but it would detract from the example. Add it for backwards compatability if for any reason. More radically, we don't accept any constructors. We return an entirely new object that has the sole purpose of accepting data before letting us at the actual object.  <br><br>
Representing two different states of an object with two different objects is the subject of an ongoing debate as well as <a href="#StateVsClass">StateVsClass</a>. <br><br>
Rather than using <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a> to check the class membership of objects passed in, we could just as easily accept <a href="#NamedArguments">NamedArguments</a>. The choose is a matter of what feels right, and what is adequate without being overkill. <br><br>
In brief, returning a custom object, partially configured by some argument, ready to either do work or accept more configuration, is the act of currying. More correctly, constructing a function to accept single arguments and return another function, or converting an existing function to such, is currying. <br><br>
<pre>
  sub create_roulette_table {
    my $color;
    my $money;
    my $numbers;
    return sub {
      $color = shift;
      return sub {
        $money = shift;
        return sub {
          push @$numbers, shift;
          return sub {
            # play logic here
          };
        };
      };
    };
  }

  # to use, we might do something like:

  my $table = create_roulette_table()->('red')->('500')->(8);
  $table->(); # play
  $table->(); # play again

  # or we might do something like:

  my $table_no_money = create_roulette_table()->('red')->('500');
  my $table;
  $table = $table_no_money->(100);
  $table->(); # play
  $table->(); # play again -- oops, lost everything
  $table = $table_no_money->(50);
  $table->(); # play some more
  
</pre>
This is stereotypical of currying as you'd see it in a language like Lisp. The arguments are essentially untyped, so we take them one at a time, in a specific order. Also like Lisp, the code quickly migrates across the screen then ends aburptly with a large number of block closes (the curley brace in Perl, paranthesis in Lisp). The Lisp version makes heavy use of <a href="#RunAndReturnSuccessor">RunAndReturnSuccessor</a>. If we wanted to adapt this logic to spew out <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?GeneratedMethods">GeneratedMethods</a>, where each method generated wasn't tied to other generated methods, we would need to explicitly copy the accumulated lexical variables rather than simply binding to them. For example, <i>my $color = $color; my $money = shift;</i> would prevent each anonymous routine returned from sharing the same <i>$color</i> variable, although without further logic, they would all have the same value. This amounts to the distinction between instance and class data. <br><br>
Understanding the Lisp-ish example isn't critical to using this idea. It merely serves to give us some context to the idea, and a counter-example to the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> approach. It also clearly demonstrates the advantages of having partially constructed objects laying around: we don't need to construct a whole new table just to put  some more money down, but we have the power of creating objects to represent state at the same time. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="CloningPattern"><h2>CloningPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: You have an object which is wholly or partly a container for data.  You want to pass or work with a copy of it so you can preserve the original.  Instead of probing into its innards from outside, you implement it, re-implement  it, to have a clone() method, that makes an exact duplicate of it from the inside.  <br><br>
When: You want to keep an unmodified copy of an object around, or you want to  play with a copy of an object without hurting the original. <br><br>
Symptoms: You're querying all of the fields out of one object, and passing them to the accessor methods of another object of the same type. Or, you access the  underlining data structure directly, looping over the fields in one object,  assigning the values to another.  You spend a lot of effort to set up objects  with are similar to each other.  <br><br>
Cloning must be designed into an object, or added in subclass. Usually.  Subclasses of a class with a clone() interface that add features to the class  need to override the ancestors clone() method and augment it to handle the new  features. Since only a designer of a class will know for sure how to correctly  clone it, it must be implemented with each package that features it.  <br><br>
Cloning lets you distribute or play with copies of objects. It also lets you  more easily make a series of similar objects, using one object as a template  for others.  <br><br>
For objects based on hashes, an extremely simple implementation of this might look like: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Mumble;

  sub new { ... }; # standard constructor

  sub clone {
    my $self = shift;
    my $copy = { %$self };
    bless $copy, ref $self;
  };

</pre>
Note that this is a ShallowCopy<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ShallowCopy">+</a>, not a DeepCopy<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DeepCopy">+</a>: <i>clone()</i> will return an object that holds additional references to things that the object being copied holds onto. If it were a DeepCopy<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DeepCopy">+</a>, the new copy would have it's own private copies of things. This is only an issue when the object being copied refers to other objects, perhaps delegating to them. A DeepCopy<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DeepCopy">+</a> is a recursive copy. It requires that each and every object in this network implement <i>->clone()</i>, though we could always fall back on reference sharing and fake it. <br><br>
<pre>
    my $copy = { %$self };

</pre>
<i>%$self</i> expands the hash reference, <i>$self</i>, into a hash. This is done in a list context, so all of the key-value pairs are expanded returned out - this is done by  value, creating a new list.  This happens in side of the <i>{ }</i> construct, which creates a new anonymous hash. This is assigned to <i>$copy</i>. <i>$copy</i> will then be a reference to all of the same data as <i>$this</i>,  The end result is a duplicate of everything in side of <i>$self</i>. This is the same thing as: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub clone {
    my $self = shift;
    my $copy;
    foreach my $key (keys %$self) {
      $copy->{$key} = $self->{$key};
    }
    bless $copy, ref $self;
  }

</pre>
If we wanted to do a DeepCopy<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DeepCopy">+</a>, we could modify this slightly: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub clone {
    my $self = shift;
    my $copy;
    foreach my $key (keys %$self) {
      if(ref $self->{$key}) {
        $copy->{$key} = $self->{$key}->clone(); 
      } else {
        $copy->{$key} = $self->{$key};
      }
    }
    bless $copy, ref $self;
  }

</pre>
This assumes that <i>$self</i> contains no hashrefs, arrayrefs, and so on - only scalar values and other objects. This is hardly a reasonable assumption, but this example illustrates the need for and implementation of recursion when cloning nested object structures. <br><br>
<a href="#MomentoPattern">MomentoPattern</a> has an example of copying an objects data against its permission - something that shouldn't be made a habit. <br><br>
Clone Factories keep a pool of archetypical objects, and return slightly  modified copies on request. XXX - example. <br><br>
Permutations exist where other objects serve as general purpose object cloners  or copiers. Due to Perl's introspective nature, a great deal of detail can be  replicated. However, this will not always be safe, as some packages have  special arrangements with their contents, some objects cannot handle multiple  references existing to them, and so forth. This violates the encapsulation  principle.  <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="FlyweightPattern"><h2>FlyweightPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: A class of very light weight objects are being used in large numbers. Reusing objects by sharing references would save a lot of memory. <br><br>
Solution: Instead of creating thousands of identical copies of objects, keep a  cache, and hand out references to existing copies. <br><br>
When: You're passing a lot of simple objects around. You're using objects as a  sort of enumeration. You've just gone OO overboard and made everything an object. <br><br>
Symptoms: Object Oriented programming is at odds with memory usage.  <br><br>
A Flyweight is a permutation of an <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a>. A million tiny objects can weigh a ton. By keeping only one copy of each, memory usage can be dramatically reduced. <br><br>
<pre>

  my $objectCache;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $value = shift;  # just a scalar

    } else {

      bless $this, $type;
      $objectCache->{$type}->{$value} = $this;
      return $this;
    }
  }

</pre>
This example returns an object if we have one for that type and value. If not,  it creates one, and caches it. An observant reader will note that if we cache  objects, give it to two people, and one person changes it, the other will be  affected. There are two solutions: pass out read-only objects, or preferably, use  ImmutableObjects<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImmutableObjects">+</a>. <br><br>
As an alternative, Perl lets you bless scalars, which weigh about the same as  an object reference. Blessed scalars aren't subject to the requirement that  they be shared copies. Blessing a scalar into a package gives you an OO  interface to a single value. If needed, you can later upgrade the  implementation to a full blown hash, and keep the same interface. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TinyNumberOb">TinyNumberOb</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $value = shift; # scalar value
    my $this = \$value; # scalar reference
    bless $this, $type;
  }

  sub getValue {
    my $self = shift;
    return $$self;
  }

  sub setValue {
    my $self = shift;
    $$self = shift;
    return 1;
  }

</pre>
This is kind of like Perl's Autovivication of variables and hash and array entries: things spring into existance at the moment a user asks for them.  <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ImmutableObject"><h2>ImmutableObject</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: Small objects that can or should be shared, but change state. <br><br>
When: You have a lot of little objects that sometimes keep one value, but  sometimes change value. When someone changes the value of one, you don't want  that change to show up in all of the other objects that have a pointer to that  object, but you don't want to have to make a clone of that object for each  object that has it, either. <br><br>
Symptoms: Frequently copying objects and passing them out. <br><br>
Lots and lots of tiny objects can eat up memory. If you've gone so far as to  represent even little things as objects, you may find that your memory isn't  going as far as it used to when everything was just a scalar. You would pass  out the same object to everyone, but you really want everyone to have a private copy of it.  <br><br>
With a small change in how your module is used, you can declare that a given  instance of it never changes values. If your object computes a new value, it  returns a new instance of itself with that new value.  <br><br>
Instead of writing: <br><br>
<pre>
  $number->add(10);

</pre>
You'll write instead: <br><br>
<pre>
  $number = $number->add(10);

</pre>
Other modules using the old $number can continue doing so in confidence, while  every time you change yours, you get a brand new one all your own. If your  class is a blessed scalar, your add() method might look like: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub add {
    my $me = shift;
    my $newval = $$me + shift;
    return bless \$newval, ref $me;
  }

</pre>
Returning new objects containing the new state is strictly required for  overloading Perl operators. Java's String class (different than <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?StringBuffer">StringBuffer</a>)  are an example of this: you can never make changes to a String, but you can ask an existing String to compute a new String for you. <br><br>
<a href="#StatePattern">StatePattern</a> talks about a mechanism for implementating state that consists of  one <a href="#ImmutableObject">ImmutableObject</a> taking another in itis constructor, and digesting it to initialize itself. Coupled with an <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a> to arbitrare which subtype  will be used for the next object, this is a powerful construct. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="AbstractFactory"><h2>AbstractFactory</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Code that decides which of several subclasses to instantiate is being cut and paste around the program. <br><br>
Solution: Centralize that logic in an object which returns a subtype of some abstract type. <br><br>
When: Any time polymorphism is needed: the option of subclassing should be kept open. See <a href="#AbstractRootClasses">AbstractRootClasses</a>. Based on circumstance, an object may be created from one of a number of subclasses. The decision of which type of object to create doesn't seem  to belongs where the object is created, but rather somewhere neutral. <br><br>
Symptoms: You split a class into two, or introduce a new or different  implementation of a class under a different name. Suddenly you find yourself  going through all of the code looking for references to the old package. You  know that if you make a similar change in the future, you'll have to go through  all of the code again.  <br><br>
<li> AbstractFactories<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractFactories">+</a> create AbstractObjects<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractObjects">+</a>. <li> Abstract objects aren't real objects. They're empty. <li> This sounds pretty damn useless. <li> Contimplate that objects extending a class, empty or not, are considered to be of that type (IS-A). <li> Aha! We're creating real objects that implement a common subtype, or interface. <li> An interface just tells everyone the object is usable in a given role. <li> Logic to decide which object to create based on parameters... <li> ... Rather than spreading the logic around everywhere that something of that base class is created. <li> "Refactor" subclasses into smaller subclasses without breaking everything. <li> Easily plug in more classes - only one point of change. <li> Easily swap out one class in favor of another - one point of change. <li> Good for when you're rewriting crummy code some lazy programmer left for you. <br><br>
An Abstract Factory makes the decision of which class or subclass to create when  you don't want to tie yourself to only one possibility. This is useful to: <li> Create a single point in the code that a single value can be hardcoded safely and changed easily. <li> House the logic that makes the decision of which of several to create. This creates the possibility of turning the class you're instantiating into a number of subclasses, or you're creating one of several objects implementing an abstract class (a certain interface) that aren't even related. <br><br>
The return value for the method is the base class type or abstract class type (essentially the same in Perl). <br><br>

</pre>
To be OO "pure" (polymorphic) each kind of car should @ISA = (Car), so that they pass the $ob->isa('Car') test. This lets programs know that it is a car (reguardless of kind) and can thus be used interchangably.  <br><br>
If you just want to cheat and bless something into a package: <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::Factory">Factory</a>;

  sub create_car {
    # this way we can do <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::Factory">Factory</a>->create_car(...) or $carfactoryref->create_car(...)
    my $package = shift; $package = ref $package if ref $package;
  
    my $car = new <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::GenericAmericanCar">GenericAmericanCar</a>;
  
    my $kind = shift;
  
    return bless $car, 'Car::Ford' if $kind eq 'ford';
    return bless $car, 'Car::Dodge' if $kind eq 'dodge';
    return bless $car, 'Car::Buick' if $kind eq 'buick';
    return bless $car, 'Car::Pontiac' if $kind eq 'pontiac';
    die "I don't think we make $kind in this country. Try Mexico."; 
  }

</pre>
If you do something like that, you will prolly want <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::Ford">Ford</a> to inherit  <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::GenericAmericanCar">GenericAmericanCar</a> with a line at the top reading  @ISA = qw(Car::GenericAmericanCar Car) so that the methods continue to be available after you re-bless it (and so that they are marked as being a Car). Going hog wild, we could make our code do this for us: <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::Factory">Factory</a>;
  
  sub create_american_car {
    my $package = shift; $package = ref $package if ref $package;
  
    my $car = new <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Car/">Car</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Car::GenericAmericanCar">GenericAmericanCar</a>;
  
    my $kind = ucfirst(shift());

    push @{$kind.'::ISA'}, 'Car', 'Car::GenericAmericanCar';
  
    return bless $car, 'Car::' . $kind;

  }
  
</pre>
There! No matter what kind of car the user requests, we create it - even if it didn't exist before we created it. We set the <i>@ISA</i> array to inherit from <i>Car</i> and <i>Car::GenericAmericanCar</i>. Even if the package was completely empty, it now contains the minimal amount of definition to make it useful: an inheritance. You probably don't want to do exactly this, unless you really want the same product rebadged with a bizarre variety of different names. <br><br>
a good example of an abstract factory would be building a system that worked with mod_perl 1 and mod_perl 2. Eventually, I'll get round to giving you an example of this - nwetters <br><br>

Problem: The exact implemenation of an object varies. <br><br>
Solution: Create a factory that centralizes the decision making logic surrounding  which implementation to use. Channel all requests for objects of for that role through the factory. <br><br>
A <a href="#FactoryObject">FactoryObject</a> has a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?FactoryMethod">FactoryMethod</a>. <br><br>
The basic factory always creates objects of the same concrete type.  Factories, as objects, are pluggable: Which factory is used, and therefore which concrete type is created by it, can be changed. <br><br>
<pre>
  my $factory = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?FordFactory">FordFactory</a>; 

  my $wifes_car = $factory->create_car(); 
  $wifes_car->isa('Car') or die; 

  # later:

  $factory = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ChevyFactory">ChevyFactory</a>;

  my $husbands_car = $factory->ChevyFactory;
  $husbands_car->isa('Car') or die; 

</pre>
Code need not be concerned with where the cars come from, only that a <i>Car</i> materialize upon demand. Having a second source available for things is  important. If there were only one auto manufacturer, a lot fewer people would be happy with their ride. Ralph Nader never would have won a law suit against them. The same goes for programs. Hacking up an entire program to change which implementation you use is undesireable. Sometimes you have an implementation you really want to get rid of. <br><br>
Usually the decision is made at some point in configuration which factory is to be used, though it may be used to implement the <a href="#StatePattern">StatePattern</a>. <br><br>
A Factory will always create objects of the same concrete type. Contrast this with the <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a>: <br><br>
Per <a href="#AbstractRootClasses">AbstractRootClasses</a>, all objects of a new type should be an AbstractType<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractType">+</a> and a concrete implementation of it. This lets you talk about objects in terms of type where <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a> is concerned and not have to change those type delcarations when a new implementation is introduced. <br><br>
An <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a> will create objects of a fixed AbstractType<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractType">+</a> and a conrete type of it's chosing. <br><br>
A plain old factory is useful when we're able to deturmine at some point what type all future manufactured objects should have for a concrete type. An <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a> is suitable when this decision can never be finalized: the current state of the running program always sways the decision. <br><br>

Synopsis: Flow control is spread all over the place. Understanding and  modifying flow requires knowledge of many modules, which is error prone.  Instead, you centralize transitions in flow, and represent state transitions  as objects. Each state object knows how to create an object representing any  state immediately accessible from itself. <br><br>
When: Applications, or modules that perform many functions at different times. <br><br>
Symptoms: Programs that people are scared of editing for fear of inserting  terminal bugs. Programs that stop unexpectedly. <br><br>
"The Halting Problem" is a subject of much research. No technique exists for  predicting when an arbitrary program will suddenly stop running and bail out.  Programmers of critical systems are deeply concerned with whether or not their  programs contain unexpected conditions that would cause sudden, catastrophic  termination. Modeling the program flow isn't a complete answer, but it  addresses two important problems:  <br><br>
<li> If we find out that the state we're in in unexpected, we can abort, and go to  the previous state. Thus, any error that can be caught has an easy, generic solution. <br><br>
<li> Users causing fatal situations by doing two or more unexpected things in  sequence is minimized, as the state of the program between each transition is  clearly defined. Global information is minimized: while a program is in code  related to a specific state, information specific to that state can live  somewhere inside that state. When transitioning to the next state, the  information that can be passed to the next state is limited to well defined  object types accepted by the new state. <br><br>
Each state would have a method that, given user input or the result of a  computation, would return another state object, to be executed. Queues and  Stacks can extend the possibilities: the basic idea is only to model the transitions. <br><br>

Of course, rather than iterating through <i>$parser</i> and using it as a generator,  we could blow the stack and make it do the recursive calls itself. In general, <i>return $foo;</i> would be replaced with <i>return $foo->();</i>. <br><br>
XXX I wonder if parser could do $_[0] = <i>next object</i> so that merely saying $parser->(foo) would work in place of $parser = $parser->(foo).. that would be nifty! <br><br>
The observant reader will notice that each anonymous subroutine we define represents a state in our grammar. At any given moment, there are only a few things which are  valid, so there is no point in looking for everything. Doing so would lead to confusion and bugs. We could rewrite this to be cleaner and use fewer variables, but I choose this  presentation because of its extremely regular structure.  <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="StateVsClass"><h2>StateVsClass</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: The base class is simple and subclasses are frequently implementing  the same features on top of the base class, but in different combinations. <br><br>
Solution: Allow objects to handle methods differently depending on their state, rather than demand that every possibily behavior be exhibited by a seperate object. Move shared behavior upwards even if not every subclass ultimately uses it. Make the base class the general, and allow subclasses to remove features - permenently or conditionally -  to create special purpose version. <br><br>
Given a special case of something that isn't really one at all, refactor. Gimpy versions of objects are still merely versions of those objects.  Lack of feature doesn't automatically make something a candidate for superclasshood. In general, there is no harm adding functionality to the base class: this is often the cleanist solution, and the quickist way to make it available to all of the subclasses. <a href="#DecoratorPattern">DecoratorPattern</a> talks about a degenerate situation where <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MixIns">MixIns</a> attempt to create endless combinations of features and ultimately fail.  <br><br>
Simple Rules: <li> The result of invoking ->isa() on the objects should always make sense. If ->isa() disagrees, the design is wrong. <li> The general case should be the superclass. A parrot that could not <i>perch()</i> is still a parrot.  <li> Don't confuse stateful behavior with the need to subclass. <br><br>
A parrot that is as dead as a door nail is still just a special case of parrots,  and parrots in general have facilities to <i>perch()</i>, <i>squak()</i>, <i>eat()</i> and <i>bite()</i>. Whether or not these facilities are working, or what the exact behavior of them can be left to the subclass. Perhaps the parrot is pining for the fjords and doesn't feel like <i>squak()</i>ing. Perhaps its deceased, but a parrot nonetheless. <br><br>
Inheritance is "specialized case of", not "made out of". A bird is not a specialized case of a beak and legs. For composing something out of mix and match parts, use composition: see <a href="#CompositePattern">CompositePattern</a>. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="CommandObject"><h2>CommandObject</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: Use a Value Object to communicate the details of the action that is desired. <br><br>
When: There is a proliferation of similar methods, and the interface to  implement that kind of object is becoming unwieldy.  <br><br>
Symptoms: Too many public methods for other objects to call. An interface that  is unworkable and always changing. You feel that a method name must include  prose describing the exact action, and this is preventing layering your code. <br><br>
A <a href="#CommandObject">CommandObject</a> is a case of using a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ValueObject">ValueObject</a> to communicate which action is to be performed, along with any argument data. This is sent to a single  method in the class that handles commands of the given type. That object is  free to implement command processing with a switch, a variable method dispatch,  or a call to a variable subclass. This lets you make changes to which commands  are defined only in the definition of the command objects itself and the  classes that actually use that command, rather than every class that wants to  implement the command processing interface. It also frees up the command  implementing the command processing interface to use any number of ideas for  dispatching the command, once it has it: <br><br>
<pre>
  # example of a switch style arrangement:

  sub doCommand {
    my $me = shift;
    my $cmd = shift; $cmd->isa('BleahCommand') or die;
    my $instr = $cmd->getInstructionCode();
    if($instr eq 'PUT') {
      # PUT logic here
    } elsif($instr eq 'GET') {
      # GET logic here
    }
    # etc
  }

  # example of a variable method call arrangement:
  
  sub doCommand {
    my $me = shift;
    my $cmd = shift; $cmd->isa('BleahCommand') or die;
    my $instr = $cmd->getInstructionCode();
    my $func = "process_" . $instr;
    return undef unless defined &$func;
    return $func->($cmd, @_);
  }

  # example of a variable subclass arrangement.
  # this assumes that %commandHandlers is set up with a list of object references.

  sub doCommand {
    my $me = shift;
    my $cmd = shift; $cmd->isa('BleahCommand') or die;
    my $insr = $cmd->getInstructionCode();
    my $objectRef = $commandHandlers{$instr};
    return $objectRef ? $objectRef->handleCommand($cmd, @_) : undef;
  }

</pre>
Since Perl offers AUTOLOAD, this idea could be emulated. If a package wanted to process an arbitrary and growing collection of commands to the best of its  ability, it could catch all undefined method calls using AUTOLOAD, and then  attempt to dispatch them (this assumes %commandHandlers is set up with a list  of object references keyed by method name): <br><br>
<pre>
  sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $me = shift;
    (my $methodName) = $AUTOLOAD m/.*::(\w+)$/;
    return if $methodName eq 'DESTROY';
    my $objectRef = $commandHandlers{$methodName};
    return $objectRef ? $objectRef->handleCommand($methodName, @_) : undef;
  }

</pre>
This converts calls to different methods in the current object to calls to a  handleCommand() method is different objects. This is an example of using Perl  to shoehorn a Command Object pattern onto a non Command Object interface. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="IteratorInterface"><h2>IteratorInterface</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: Create a unified interface for iterating through data items. <br><br>
When: You have objects that contain sets of things, or you have objects that  are arranged into structures. <br><br>
Symptoms: Each package has a slightly different way to look through data items it contains. <br><br>
This is a specific example of a general idea: if there is a kind of thing that  needs done, create an abstract class (a package that has only empty methods)  that outlines a general interface for doing it. In this case, we're concerned  about looping through a collection of values: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Iterator;

  sub hasNext { die; }
  sub getNext { die; }

</pre>
Other packages can come along and add Iterator to their @ISA list. They will  need to redefine these methods. Now we have a uniform way of doing something.  If a method in an object is expecting an Iterator as its argument, it has a  way of checking to see if its argument really is an Iterator. It can be an  Iterator and anything, else, too. This supports Type Safety. <br><br>
This is a simple case. If an object doesn't directly contain the values, but  instead references a network of items, we can recurse over them. This can be  wrapped in an Iterator interface. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?SampleTree">SampleTree</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $this = { @_ };

    bless $this, $type;
  }

  sub getIterator {
    my $this = shift;
    return new <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Foo/">Foo</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Foo::Iterator">Iterator</a> node=>$this;
  }

  sub get_left {
    my $this = shift;
    return $this->{'leftNode'};
  }

  sub get_right {
    my $this = shift;
    return $this->{'rightNode'};
  }

  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/SampleTree/">SampleTree</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=SampleTree::Iterator">Iterator</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my %opts = @_;
    my $this = {state=>0, iterator=>undef, node=>$opts{'node'};
    bless $this, $type;
  }

  sub getNext {
    my $this = shift;
    my $result;
    if($this->{'iterator'}) {
      $result = $this->{'iterator'}->getNext();
    }
    if($result) { 
     return $result;
    } elsif($this->{'state'} == 0) {
      # try the left node
      $this->{'iterator'} = $this->{'node'}->get_left();
      $this->{'state'} = 1; 
      return $this->getNext();
    } elsif($this->{'state'} == 1) {
      # try the right node
      $this->{'state'} = 2;
      $this->{'iterator'} = $this->{'node'}->get_right();
      return $this->getNext();
    } else {
       # state == 2
       return undef;
    }
  }

</pre>
This <a href="#footnote17">[17]</a> code allows a network of objects having the getIterator  method to cooperatively and transparently work together. Each object in the  network may have a different way of iterating. This example represents a tree  datastructure. The tree may contain other tree nodes, array objects, queues,  and so forth. As long the network consists of objects with a getIterator()  method that returns an object that implements the Iterator iterface, we can  crawl through the whole thing. Thats composition you can take to the bank and  smoke! <br><br>
Iteratoring through data sets which your object contains or which other objects contain is all fine and dandy, but this same interface gives us everything we need to iterator over data sets that don't exist at all, except perhaps in our imagination. The things we iterate over could be things that we know to exist from theory, like prime numbers. Computing things from a large set as they are needed, rather than beforehand, is called <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LazyEvaluation">LazyEvaluation</a>. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LazyEvaluation">LazyEvaluation</a> lets you set up pipelines where different parts of the program do operations on data as it is generated or read. Contrast this with the typical Perl approach of slurping everything into memory, then working on it: <br><br>
<pre>
  # slurp everything into memory, then work on it:

  open my $file, 'dataset.cvs' or die $!;
  read $file, my $data, -s $file or die $!;
  close $file;

  foreach my $i (split /\n/, $data) {
    # process
  }

  # process as we read:

  my $process = sub {
    # process
  };

  open my $file, 'dataset.cvs' or die $!;
  while(my $record = &lt;$file>) {
    $process->($record);
  }
  close $file;

</pre>
Returning all of the data from a <i>get_</i> method fosters slurping everything into memory. This fosters programers which are limited by memory in how large of datasets they can work on. You can chuckle and say that virtual memory will take up the slack, but if I can tell you that there are a heck of a lot of multi terrabyte data warehouses kicking around the world. Dealing with data in place, where your storage is essentially at capacity at all times, or having multiple clients process a very large dataset in  parallel demands efficiency. There are still a few applications for good programmers and a few applications for good programmers to write. <br><br>
The second example above, rewritten as a <i>provider</i>: <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?RecordReader">RecordReader</a>;

  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>;
  @ISA = qw(Interface);

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $file = shift;
    open my $filehandle, $file or die $!;
    my $me = { handle => $filehandle, next => undef };
    bless $me, $type;
  }

  sub getNext {
    return $next if defined $next;
    return &lt;$handle>;
  }

  sub hasNext {
    return 1 if defined $next;
    $next = &lt;$me>;
    if($next) {
      return 1; 
    } else {
      close $fh;
      return 0;
    }
  }

</pre>
Compare this to Java's IO Filters, which will superimpose read of  datastructures, international characters, and so forth on top of IO strems:  you'll find it to be remarkably similar. It lets users mix and match IO  processing facilities. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="PassingPattern"><h2>PassingPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Generally, create things where it makes sense to, and pass them down  constructors, leaving contained objects to do with them what they wish, rather  than making assumptions about their structure. Given an A that creates a B,  and B needs a C that only A can create, create C, pass it to A's constructor,  and let A pass it to B itself, rather than trying to take charge and set up all of the relationships yourself.  Extension of idea of encapsulation.  <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="WrapperModule"><h2>WrapperModule</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: Want to use several modules across a collection of scripts, but don't want dozens of "use" lines at the top of each. <br><br>
There is incentive not to split up bloated modules due to the need to go through and edit all of the scripts to use each new module-spawn. This also has all of the markings of a problem that resurfaces: should you refactor again, you'll be changing all of your modules. Leaving everything in one module is tempting. <br><br>
In days of lore, Perl programmers would <i>require</i> a single <i>config.pl</i> that set up variables and <i>require</i>ed other modules for them. <i>use</i> doesn't automatically preclude this - merely leave off the <i>package</i> statement, and you'll continue operating in the namespace of the program that <i>use</i>d your module. <br><br>
For example, in config.pm: <br><br>
<pre>
  # note: no package statement

  use DBI;
  use CGI;
  use <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Mail/">Mail</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Mail::Sendmail">Sendmail</a>;

</pre>
Back in the main program: <br><br>
<pre>
  use config;

  my $userid = <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CGI/">CGI</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=CGI::param">param</a>('userid');
  # etc...

</pre>
<i>my</i> variables are file-global when declared outside of any code blocks, which means that we can't easily declare lexical variables in config.pm and have them show up in the main program. We can co-opt the import() method of config.pm to create <i>local</i> variables in the main program, though: <br><br>
<pre>
  # back in config.pm:

  my %config = (
    maxusers => 100,
    retriespersecond => 2,
    loglevel => 5
  );

  sub import {
    my $caller = caller;
    foreach my $i (keys %config) {
      local ${$caller.'::'.$i};
      *{$caller.'::'.$i} = $config{$i};
    }
  }

</pre>
This will atleast squelsh any warnings Perl would otherwise emit and let us return to importing configuration dependent values from a configuration file. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="AnonymousSubroutineObjects"><h2>AnonymousSubroutineObjects</h2><br> <br><br>
<b>Blessed Coderef</b> <br><br>
You should be familiar with this by now: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Preferences;

  sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    bless {color=>$args{'color'}, petname=>$args{'petname'}, street=>{'street'} }, $class;
  }

  sub query_color { return $_[0]->{'color'}; }
  sub set_color { return $_[0]->{'color'} = $_[1]; }
  # other accessors here

  1;

  package main;

  $| = 1;

  print "Whats your favorite color? "; my $color = &lt;STDIN>;
  print "Whats your pets name? "; my $petname = &lt;STDIN>;
  print "What street did you grow up on? "; my $street = &lt;STDIN>;

  my $foo = new Preferences (color=>$color, petname=>$petname, street=>$street);

</pre>
The string "color" appears ten times. Ten! In Perl, no less. If I wrote out the constructors for the other arguments, this would be repeated for each variable. Shame. If we trust the user to pass in the right things to the constructor, we can get rid of two. Still, even typing each thing eight times is begging for a typo to come rain on your parade. <br><br>
If you're a LISP or Scheme programmer, you wouldn't even consider writing an autocracy like this. You'd probably write something like: <br><br>
<pre>
  package main;

  $| = 1;

  sub get_preferences {
    print "Whats your favorite color? "; my $color = &lt;STDIN>;
    print "Whats your pets name? "; my $petname = &lt;STDIN>;
    print "What street did you grow up on? "; my $street = &lt;STDIN>;
    return <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a> sub {
      my $arg = shift;
      ({
        query_color => sub { return $color; }
        set_color => sub { $color = shift; return 1; }
        # etc
      }->{$arg} || sub { die "Unknown request: $arg" })->(@_);
    };
  }

  my $ob = get_preferences();
  print $ob->get_street(), "\n";

</pre>
First, the { query_name => sub { } }->{$arg}->(@_) is a sort of switch/case statement. It creates an anonymous hash of names to functions, then looks up one of the functions by name, using the first argument passed in. Once we have that code reference, we execute it and pass it our unused arguments. Then we've added a default case to it, so we don't try to execute undef as code. This could have been coded using if/elsif/else just as easily. <br><br>
Don't confuse the this case idiom {name=>sub{}}->{$arg}->(@_) with =8>-()<, the rubber chicken idiom. <br><br>
The get_preferences() routine sets some variables, then returns a code reference. "my" variables get created when they're declared, and they don't get destroyed until no one can see them any more. Since the code reference we're ruturning when we say "return <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a> sub { }" can see these variables, and we can see this code reference, Perl doesn't get rid of them. They continue to live on, and keep their same values, as if the subroutine they were created in had never returned. What this means to us is that we don't have to copy the value from one variable into a hash when we create an object! This saves us having type the variable name as we pass it, specify what the variable should be named in the hash that gets passed, then goes on to save us from having to do the same steps in reverse once the object gets the hash passed to it. With the same security, we've cut the use of the word "color" in half, down to 5 uses. <br><br>
If you think of Perl's sub { } feature as preserving the exact state of "my" variables in a routine, you'll think of countless applications for returning anonymous subroutines. Object Oriented object creation is much more explicit, so you may find yourself getting lost in code like this. If you figure out where an anonymous subroutine was defined, then start reading the code leading up to it, you'll find where the variables are declared, and where their values are set. The cost of the reduced typing is reduced redundancy, which can make the program both harder and easier to read at the same time. <br><br>
Normal Objects: <li> Copy data - new values are independent. <li> Passed via arguments to a method call to new(). <li> Method is called and evaluated when the object is created. <br><br>
Lexically Defined Object: <li> Share variables - changes to variables inside the object are reflected inside and vice versa. <li> Never expicitly passed - instead, the rules of lexical scope are obeyed - must be referenced inside the block they were defined in. <li> Method is created and returned when the object is created. It is not yet evaluated. <br><br>
There is one little mystery left, though. Code references are dereferenced using the $ref->(@args) syntax. $ref->function(@args) syntax is reserved for objects. We shouldn't be able to call $ob->get_street() in our example on a code reference -- unless that code reference has been blessed into a package. It just so happens that that is exactly what <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a> does. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    return $type->new(@_) if ref $type eq <u></u>PACKAGE__;
    my $ref = shift; ref $ref eq 'CODE' or die;
    bless $ref, $type;
  }

  sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $me = shift;
    (my $method) = $AUTOLOAD =~ m/::(.*)$/;
    return undef if $method eq 'DESTROY';
    return wantarray ? ($me->($method, @_)) : scalar $me->($method, @_);
  }

  1;

</pre>
Given a code reference, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MessageMethod">MessageMethod</a> blesses it into its own package. There are no methods aside from new() and AUTOLOAD(). AUTOLOAD handles undefined methods for Perl, and since there are no methods, it handles all of them. (There is an exception to that, where new() has to pass off requests). AUTOLOAD() merely takes the name of the function it is standing in for and sends that as the first argument to a call to the code reference, along with the rest of the arguments. We're translating $ob->foo('bar') into $ob->('foo', 'bar'). This does nothing but let us decorate our code reference with a nice OO style syntax. <br><br>
This is similar to Python's method lookup logic XXX, in that it returns the method as an object. <br><br>
<b>Blessed Hash full of Coderefs</b> <br><br>
<pre>
  # place this code in hashclosure.pm

  # tell Perl how to find methods in this object - run the lambda closures the object contains

  sub AUTOLOAD {
      (my $method) = $AUTOLOAD =~ m/::(.*)$/;
      return if $method eq 'DESTROY';
      our $this = shift;
      if(! exists $this->{$method}) {
        my $super = "SUPER::$method";
        return $this->$super(@_);
      }
      $this->{$method}->(@_);
  } 
  
  1;

</pre>
This code translates method calls into invocations of anonymous subroutines by the same name inside of a blessed hash: when a method is called, we look for a hash element of that name, and if we find it, we execute it as a code reference.  <br><br>
Dropping the above code verbatum into a .pm file it doesn't change the package,  so it defines an <i>AUTOLOAD()</i> method for the current package.  This is a <a href="#WrapperModule">WrapperModule</a> of sorts. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosures">LambdaClosures</a> and our <i>AUTOLOAD()</i> method work together to provide <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>-like easy access to <i>$this</i> and <a href="#InstanceVariables">InstanceVariables</a>. We can use object instance specific field variables directly without having to dereference a hash. <br><br>
<pre>
  package Foo;

  sub new {

    my $class = shift;  
    my %args = @_;
    our $this;

    my $foo;
    my $bar;

    bless {

      get_foo => sub { return $foo },
      set_foo => sub { $foo = shift },
      get_bar => sub { return $bar },
      set_bar => sub { $bar = shift },

      get_foo_bar_qux => sub {
        return $this->get_foo(), $this->get_bar(), get_qux();
      },

      dump_args => sub {
        foreach my $i (keys %args) {
          print $i, '=', $args{$i}, "\n";
        }
      },

    }, $class;

  }

  sub get_qux { return 300; }

</pre>
This blesses an anonymous hash reference into our package, <i>Foo</i>. This hash reference contains method names as keys and anonymous subroutines as values. <i>AUTOLOAD()</i> knows how to look into our hash and find methods by name, and run them, rather than looking for methods in the normal place. <br><br>
<i>our</i> is a strange beast. It gives us a <i>my</i> style lexical alias to a <i>local</i> style variable. We could use a <i>local</i> variable here, but <i>our</i> has a nicer syntax, and it keeps us in the lexical mode of thought.  <br><br>
<i>$foo</i>, <i>$bar</i>, <i>$this</i>, <i>$class</i> and <i>%args</i> are all lexical variables, and the subroutines we create with <i>sub { }</i> are <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosures">LambdaClosures</a> because they reference these variables. By referencing them, they bind to the one specific copy that was created when <i>new()</i> is entered. That means that each object has its own private <i>$foo</i>, for instance, and can access it directly. <i>get_qux()</i> is defined as a normal method in the preceding example. In any OO Perl code, failing to do something like <i>$this->method()</i> to call other functions in your code prevents inheritance from overriding those methods. Using this syntax keeps open the possibility of creating <a href="#TemplateMethod">TemplateMethod</a>. Where we explicit don't want subclass redefinitions of methods to be used, way can use the <i>$this->Foo::method()</i> syntax, where <i>Foo</i> is the name of the class to search for <i>method()</i> in, usually our own package or our direct parent. <br><br>
Methods may also be defined normally and placed next to <i>new()</i>. This is useful for utility methods, or <i>static</i> methods in C++ or Java. Methods must be defined this way to be called without using the <i>$this->method()</i> syntax. <i>$this->method()</i> is required to get the <i>AUTOLOAD()</i> logic to kick in as  otherwise Perl has no knowledge of how to locate the code responsible for handing your method.  <br><br>
This is my own personal favorite idiom for creating objects in Perl: it requires the least code to acheive, and the least work on my part, and the least chance of error.  <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ConstraintSystem"><h2>ConstraintSystem</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Difficult to solve problem. All of the related logic is huge and no control structure or organisation seems to be adequate. <br><br>
Solution: Model the problem using connectors and logic items. Let scenarios play themselves out recursively across the network. <br><br>
This rather large example was adapted from code in <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>, an excellent book. The program was originally written in Scheme, the languaged featured in  Structure and Interpretation. Even if you write nothing but Perl, C or Java all of your life, I highly recommend this book. Decomposing problems into functions is the first cautious step in learning to program; decomposing programs into objects could be seen as a second and factoring out the recursive nature of complex problems a third. Complexity is the program killer, and its management is paramount in scaling programs as well as solving problems. <br><br>
In addition to adopting the example to Perl, I've adopted it to use objects rather than lambda closures. This made the code longer and less elegant, but verbose borish implementation is considered a virtue in this day and age. <br><br>
<i>Constrain::new()</i> is a wee little factory that spits out subtypes on demand. We're not actually using this right now in our code because by the time we got to the bottom of the file we forgot that we had done that. Using a factory as such is a good policy: it adds a layer of abstraction in the creation of objects, and each layer of abstraction is insurance against change, giving us a single place where we can translate the old interface to whatever is new. <br><br>
<i>Constrain::Adder</i> is our first and only serious logic componenet. It should be  refactored into a base class with a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TemplateFunction">TemplateFunction</a> and a sample implementation. Perhaps I'll get around to this later XXX, as it would make this code more directly useful to random purposes. When told what its value should be, it lashes back, sending a message out on one of its connectors informing the objects on that connector what value they must have to satisfy the condition. The <i>Adder</i> object does whatever it must to  satisfy the constraint. The three inputs are identical in that they are all connections that may be connected to any other logic devices. They differ in that the last will be the sum of the first two. If any single inputs value is unspecified, a value will be sent out on that connector. If all values are specified after a new value comes in, the last output is the one we force to fit the constraint. Should it not wish to do so, it may in turn push out a new value by calling <i>setvalue()</i> on the connector. Eventually, a solution that all nodes are happy with will be arrived at, or else every possibility will be exhausted. XXX, return failure should we be unable to arrive at a solution. This component has exactly three connections. <br><br>
<i>Constrain::Probe</i> describes an object that merely repeats to the screen any  value it is told to have. This componenet has exactly one connection. <br><br>
<i>Constrain::Constant</i> asserts a value on the wire and refuses to accept any other value. Should it be told to be another value, it fights back, pushing its own value back out again. This componenet has exactly one connection. <br><br>
Finally, <i>Constrain::Connector</i> isn't a logical component at all - just a wire or messenger between them. It has no behavior of its own other than to relay messages from one connection out on the other connections. The above components each have a fixed number of inputs - not so with a connector. A connector may be connected to any number of components.  <br><br>

Its useful to barrow the idea of relationships from Relational Database  Management Systems (relational databases). In fact, many large enterprise  applications are actually collections of specialized applications all built  around one large data warehouse. Records in the database are represented in  software by objects. These objects can be queried for things they related to:  other objects representing records. <br><br>
<li> One to one correspondence between two different things: a person has one  social security number and a social security number refers to one (living) person. <li> One object may refer to several others: a person may oven several pets.  <li> An intersection of sets: many people have tried many flavors of ice cream.  Asking a person which ice cream flavors they have tried returns a list; asking  which people have tried a flavor of ice cream also returns a list. <br><br>
In the same way, object oriented systems that aren't backed by a database still have one to one, one to many, and many to many relationships between the  objects. It can be useful exercise to sit down with pencil and paper and map  out which kinds of relationships which kinds of objects are going to have. This  often exposes design limits in a system where the things can happen in reality  that the software isn't prepared for. <br><br>

Individual people each having a distinct set of traits can be expressed cleanly with three tables. Any fewer would lead to <a href="#SelfJoiningData">SelfJoiningData</a> and an ever increasing number of columns holding primary, secondard, trinary, and so on indefinately, positional attributes, which can only be used in queries with great pain and modifications each time a new slot is added. Any more tables leads to the same problem, but with constant introduction of tables rather than attributes.  <br><br>
The <i>People</i> table exists exactly as expected: a list of people, with columns for things that each and every person has. <br><br>
All attribute tables need to be generalized into one. Any further attribute specific data may <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?OutterJoin">OutterJoin</a> to the <i>Attribute</i> table but should not be included in the attribute table itself: only the columns which describe  the each and every attribute and nothing else.  <br><br>
Normalize the <i>People</i> table so that <i>AttributeID</i>s don't exist in it. The rules of normalization state that any time we're attempting to hold an array of data in one record, we really want a 3rd independent table. This is exactly what we need to do. <i>People</i> contains <i>PeopleID</i>.  <i>Attribute</i> contains <i>AttributeID</i>. <i>PeopleToAttribute</i> contains one <i>PeopleID</i> and one <i>AttributeID</i> per record. Each <i>PeopleID</i> may occur any number of times, and each <i>AttributeID</i> may occur any numbers of times, and these may occur in any combination.  <i>PeopleToAttribute</i> is a hinge table. Hinge tables can and should contain data specific to the combination of the two IDs.  <br><br>
Badly designed databases often require repeated application of this concept. A database may list wholesale and retail prices, primary  product category, and secondary category, should be turned into a table listing <i>Product</i>s, one listing <i>Category</i>, one listing <i>PriceOption</i>, and two hinge tables. <i>ProductToCategory</i> shows the membership of each produce in each category by virtue of having a record making the connection: <br><br>
<pre>
  select count(*) as isDongle
  from   Product, Category, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ProductToCategory">ProductToCategory</a>
  where  Product.ProductID = <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ProductToCategory">ProductToCategory</a>.ProductID
  and    <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ProductToCategory">ProductToCategory</a>.CategoryID = Category.CategoryID
  and    Category.Name = 'Dongle'

</pre>
This query returns the number of dongles in the database. Replacing <i>count(*)</i> with a specific field list would return details of each dongle.  <br><br>
<i>PriceOption</i> contains records "Wholesale" and "Retail", but cannot contain the actual prices. Attempting to do so would be no better than putting the prices directly into <i>Product</i>. <i>ProductToPriceOption</i> not only connects <i>Product</i> to the pricing options available for it as listed in <i>PriceOption</i>, but for each pricing option, contains the actual price. Normalization dictates that each and every column in a table depend (that is, be specific to) the key, the entire key, and nothing but the key. The price depends on more than  <i>ProductID</i> in <i>Product</i> because it also depends on <i>PriceOptionID</i> in <i>PriceOption</i>. Likewise, it does not depend on just <i>PriceOptionID</i>, but also <i>ProductID</i>. <i>ProductToPriceOption</i> is keyed by both <i>PriceOptionID</i> and <i>ProductID</i>, so each record it contains is specific to both values. 3.95 may be the Retail price for "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress". <br><br>
Understanding object relationships is impossible without understanding the rules of data normalization. Failing to do so so will result in obnoxiously complex object structures with no apparent solution for making sense of them. It is critical to deciding when  to create objects, and where to place data in them. <br><br>

One to many relationships become many to many as original design assumptions  are relaxed. This lets us model more complex situations. Objects that contained one instance of a kind of another object may find themselves holding an array.  Methods that operated on this object explicitly now need to be told which one  to operate on. Defining an iterator and moving the interface to the iterator  lets us keep our concept of one and only object, but adds the concept of  moving to the next object in the list.

Problem:  <br><br>
Solution: <br><br>
In it's most basic form: <br><br>
<pre>
  my $output = new Output;
  my $backend = new Backend($output);
  $output->set_backend($backend);

</pre>
Or: <br><br>
<pre>
  my $output = new Output($this);

</pre>
Refactor as a: <br><br>
<li> <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ModelViewController">ModelViewController</a> - make the link less circular and more triangular <li> VistorPattern<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?VistorPattern">+</a> or <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WholeObject">WholeObject</a> <li> <a href="#ConstraintSystem">ConstraintSystem</a> <li> <a href="#InnerClasses">InnerClasses</a> - rather than pass the entire parent, pass a special callback object <br><br>
Should <i>$output</i> know about <i>$backend</i> or <i>$this</i>? Does it make sense for <i>$backend</i> to place a call into <i>$output</i> that requires a call back into <i>$output</i>?  <br><br>
<li> Since any method could call any other method, calls could bounce back and  forth indefinately for all we know. You'd feel better knowing that infinite, or finite-but-excesive-to-the-point-of-silly loops, aren't possible. <li> Each object's API is burdoned with the needs of the other object. <li> Each object is more concerned with the other objects data than its own - you have an <a href="#ObjectOrgy">ObjectOrgy</a>. <li> Should you decide at runtime to do away with <i>$output</i> and replace it with something else, the procedure for notifying it to drop its reference to you is odd and error prone, especially if this relationship repeats. <br><br>
<b>WholeObject</b> <br><br>
Contention for data of exactly this sort is a strong hint at a  <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ValueObject">ValueObject</a> refactoring: move the data that is of common interest into a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ValueObject">ValueObject</a> and passed whole, negating the need for a callback. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WholeObject">WholeObject</a>, <a href="#PassingState">PassingState</a>, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ValueObject">ValueObject</a> <br><br>
<b>InnerClasses</b> <br><br>
Using <a href="#InnerClasses">InnerClasses</a>, the parent class need not have its API burdoned with the special needs and interfaces of its child, and the scope of the circular  reference can be greatly reduced. An object created inside of the parent object, attached to its lexical data, can be sent off in place of <i>$this</i>. <br><br>
<pre>
  my $output = new Output;
  my $backend = new Backend($output->get_backend_adapter());
  $output->set_backend($backend->get_output_adapter());

</pre>
Or... <br><br>
<pre>
  my $output = new Output($this->get_output_adapter());

When adding and removing arguments, it can be difficult to remember the order you wanted them in. Using a hash, you can do away with arbitrary ordering. <br><br>
<pre>
  sub foo {
    my %args = @_;
    my $color = $args{color};
    my $number = $args{number};
    # ...
  }
  
  foo(color=>'red', number=>13);
  
  The || operator lets you easily provide defaults and error checking:
  
  sub foo {
    my %args = @_;
    my $color = $args{color} || 'red';
    my $number = $args{number} || die 'number=> paramer required';
    # ...
  }
  
  Or, you may explicitly list the argument names and defaults, providing a self-documenting framework:
  
  sub foo {
    my %args = (
      Arg1        => 'DefaultValue',
      Blah        => 42,
      Bleh        => 60*60*24,
      Hostname    => undef,
      @_
    );
    # Handle error-checking here
    defined $args{Hostname} or die 'Required parameter "Hostname" not defined';
  }

Synopsis: The arguments to the first function are augmented and repased to the next function, possibly recursively.  <br><br>
When: Context is built up during evaluation, and this context utliamtely turns  into the result. Recursive code that details with a variable set of variables.  In place of code that uses $$var to directly access the symbol table. <br><br>
<pre>
  my $context = { 
        increment    => sub { my $context = shift; $context->{sum}++; return ''; },
        currentvalue => sub { my $context = shift; return $context->{sum}; }
  };

  sub expand_macros {
    my $context = shift;
    my $text = shift;
    my $macro = qr{([A-Z][A-Z0-9]{2,})};
    $text =~ s/$macro/$context->{lc($1)}->($context)/ge;
    return $text;
  }

  expand_macros($context, "INCREMENT INCREMENT The current value is: CURRENTVALUE");

</pre>
This is fairly strightfoward: We can pass $context and some text containing the  macros "INCREMENT" and "CURRENTVALUE" to expand_macros(), and the macros will  increment the current value of $context->{sum} and return the value. This is a  simple template parser that finds escapes in text and replaces them with the  result of a peice of code passed in through a hash. However, since we're  maintaing our context in a hash reference, we can do this recursively: <br><br>
<pre>
  $context->{doubleincrement} = sub { 
    my $context = shift; 
    expand_macros($context, "INCREMENT INCREMENT CURRENTVALUE"); 
  }

  expand_macros($context, "The current value is: DOUBLEINCREMENT");

</pre>
Maintaining state in a hashref rather than the symbol table only requires us to  be vigilent in passing the hash ref around. We have access to the updated state  in the hashref after evaluation has finished. We can take this same context and  pass it off again. In our example, we could template something else, reusing  our same state and collection of macro definitions.  <br><br>
<li> Two bits of unrelated code can reuse the same name without worry of clobbering a value. This reduces problems with <a href="#ActionAtADistance">ActionAtADistance</a>. <li> Multiple exclusive collections of values can be maintained at once.

FUNCTION TEMPLATING <br><br>
Synopsis: Creating a custom compliment of code cleans crufty object access syntax. <br><br>
When: Your code is bloating due to another cumbersome interface.  <br><br>
"Forth" teaches that no language will be well suited to every problem, so the best language is one that is well suited to creating languages for expression solutions in general. Huh? Instead of attaching the problem head on, step back and formulate a plan involving intermediate steps to the goal. We've designed data structures using objects. We've engineered programs using objects as building blocks. Whens the last time we've designed a language to solve a problem? Any language lets you create functions, but Forth lets you create functions that create other functions (Forth calls functions "words"). We don't need to cook up a VM and a syntax to do this, though we could. Perl's VM and syntax will work. <br><br>
This is kind of a like an Abstract Factory. Objects certainly give you a way to generalize a solution, but they don't give you a mechanism to express a solution. If the solution involves making lots of method calls, the algorithm can get swamped down in OO syntax to the point where it is hidden. Removing the excess syntax is one way of refactoring code. Everyone benefits from the clarity, especially when you're trying to formulate a language as an intermediate step to solving a tough problem. <br><br>
Lets take template processing as an example. Lets say you've got various sorts of templates: templates representing HTML fragments, templates representing email templates, database queries, and so on. You could create objects to represent each type of thing, and give each a stringify() method that requires a hash argument of values to template in. You would then write a huge amount of code, mostly method calls, loops, and string concatenations.  <br><br>
Or... XXX untested code.: <br><br>

    &lt;div align="left">&lt;img src="reddot.png" height="20" width="NUMBER">&lt;/div>
  });

  print readnames();
  print readnumberbyageinstate({state=>'MD'});

</pre>
Lets take a look at what we've factored out in this example: <br><br>
<li> Preparing queries. <li> Iterating over results. <li> Templating HTML or text snippits. <li> Reading and passing arguments. <li> Recursion. <br><br>
createtemplate() is a simple example. createquery() is more advanced. A simple example appeared in Chapter XXX 3 where we created accessors for ourself.  <br><br>
For any task that is suited our mini language, we've completely factored out several tedious syntactical things. We're now free to work in a very concise, expressive, short-hand language. Yet, we still have all of the power of Perl available - we haven't given up anything. <br><br>
The key elements are: <br><br>
The returned code reference is lexically bound to the data you passed to it. The data passed to it could be any datatype, including objects, scalars, and most importantly, code references. Logic is factored out of the main program into the inner part of the "create" routine, inside of the anonymous subroutine block. <br><br>
Creating a symbol table entry (assigning the anonymous subroutine to a glob of the given name) is optional. This skip can be stepped and done manually if you find yourself mostly creating functions to pass to other functions: <br><br>
<pre>
  print createquery($readnumberbystatesql, {drawpiechart => createpiechart() }, 'drawpiechart');

</pre>
It is traditional in languages like Lisp and Scheme to skip naming things unless actually necessary. <br><br>
Next time you're getting bogged down in syntax, ask yourself if a function generator could be written that would take care of the tedious busy work. <br><br>

Die early, die often, get closer to the root of the problem. Don't let an error in one part of the program trigger problems much later in a distant, unrelated part of the program. Check arguments types, provide accessors to enforce policies and handle state changes in objects there so that they are responsible for keeping themselves consistent. <br><br>
<li> Die early and die often. <br><br>
Have <i>or die $!;</i> appear after each statement whose failure you aren't prepaired to handle otherwise. These clauses should absolutely litter your program.  <br><br>
<li> Die before the damage spreads beyond from the source. <br><br>
Should something fail unexpectedly, execution will stop at the exact point of failure, and the diagnostic will be fresh and useful. <br><br>
<li> "or die" documents what isn't supposed to happen. <br><br>
Things that a program assumes it can count on are called <i>invarients</i>. These are the basic assumptions that the program was written under. <i>or die</i> documents these in your code for all to see. <br><br>
<li> Don't let people call things you don't want them to. <br><br>
People resort to the printed documentation only when they can't figure out the interface for themselves. This applies equally to video games, digital time pieces, and software APIs. Diagnostics are more helpful than the manual, in this sense. <br><br>
<li> ...or else you'll have to support a busted interface long after you you want to get rid of it. <br><br>
This is part of "encapsulation" or "data hiding". Making part of your interface public is committing to support that design indefinately. Don't do this lightly. <br><br>
<li> Use <i>eval {}</i> for error trapping <br><br>
Sometimes you want your application to die with a useful diagnostic should an invarient by deviated from, for example when you're first installing and configuring an application, or when you're debugging it. Othertimes, you want it to do its absolute best to keep on trucking, for instance when that program is running as a mission critical service. Making no attempt to trap errors acheives the first case. For the second case, wrap <i>eval {}</i> around calls. Where you apply this technique depends on how much recovery logic you're willing to write. The more recovery logic, the closer the protective <i>eval {}</i> can be to the possible failure points. Less recovery logic means that fewer <i>eval {}</i> statements are needed. <br><br>

Code and data, time and space, lo... <br><br>
What follows is a rant on the nature of programs. While not suitable for consuption in any format, it is a thought I need to develop further, as it affects every explaination in this text. <br><br>
Some declarations run as they are encountered; some affect future behavior. Run time programing modification - self modifying code - is an example of affecting future behavior; so are lambda closures and object  instantiations.  Some languages are purely sequential: C. Some are purely declarative: Ocaml.  <br><br>
For many people, datastructures are seen as influencing  future behavior only, likewise code is always seen as executing immediately. <br><br>
Tied data, for example in our <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AccessorsPattern">AccessorsPattern</a>, and using object accessors to fetch and stow data give datastructures the property of executing immediately. Changing the implementation on the fly by using the polymorphic nature of objects makes linear comprehension of code impossible. So do lambda closures. <br><br>

Problem: Work is handled through recursion or delegation. Sometimes it is delegated back, or  recursion never terminates due to a problem out of our control. <br><br>
Solution: Use a re-entrance lock to detect and gracefully handle the situation. Set the lock on entrance and clear it on exit. <br><br>
<pre>
  my $lock;

  sub notify_all {
    if($lock) {
      warn "Don't respond to an event with an event!";
      $lock++;
    }
    foreach my $listener (@listeners) {
      $listener->send_event(@_);
    }
    $lock = 0;
  }

</pre>
In most cases, it is never an error to be called back by the object that you just called. Some times re-entry isn't an error at all, and you can silently refuse it. <a href="#ConstraintSystem">ConstraintSystem</a> uses this idea to propogate values across a network where some nodes are willing to budge and others aren't. Usually this manifests as a list of notification recipients that receive a notification, and one needs to send yet another notice to all of them except the sender of the original message, but doesn't happen to know which originated. This situation crops up with the Gnutella protocol, where nodes replay messages to every peer except the originating one, but the mesh of connections can cause the message to be accidentally routed to the originator anyway. Simpily tracking which messages you originated yours and ignoring requests to forward them again pervents a condition where a host transmits the same message out onto the net over and over. <br><br>
In yet another case, the one illustrated above, we're flatly denying recursion.  If one node responds to events of type "A" with events of type "B", and another node responds to events of type "B" with events of type "A", and we did no reentry checking, Perl would explode. It would use up all of the memory the OS would allow it, grind away for a while, blow up like a big grinding balloon, and just pop. Nobody wants that. Putting rules in place for which events may be replied to with another event will prevent this situation as well. If you do opt for policy, you may elect to put some limits in place for testing purposes. These kind of arbitrary limits can never be set correctly: what you consider an impossibly large value becomes unworkably small in a few years. For debugging, detecting what looks like a run away condition can be a life saver: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub notify_all {

    if($testing) {
      # never do this in production code!
      my $calldepth = 0;
      $callerdepth++ while(caller($calldepth));
      die "arbitrary limit exceeded: stack depth too deep, possible runaway recursion detected"
        if $callerdepth > 100;
    }
    
    foreach my $listener (@listeners) {
      $listener->send_event(@_);
    }

  }

Stand in for threads. Much more efficient in Unix. Named for the use of <i>select()</i>. <br><br>
A single inner loop waits for either a timeout, signal, or a filehandle to become available for read or write. Coordination of reading and writing and responding to other events is handled in a single, centralized, and often massive central loop. Contrast with threads where each thread has its own loop and blocks waiting for exactly one thing at any given time: an object lock, input, another thread to wake it, and so on. <br><br>
Many <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> systems are built on top of a <i>select()</i> and its style. AWT, the Java AbstractWindowsToolkit<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractWindowsToolkit">+</a> builds an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> facde on top  of the event oriented X11 platform on Unix-like hosts. <br><br>
The <a href="#SelectPollPattern">SelectPollPattern</a> is counter-intuitive for most people to use. It requires manual management of the CPU, and each task has to  completely return to the inner loop and then be called fresh. <a href="#footnote24">[24]</a> <br><br>

    my $shbit = 1 &lt;&lt; fileno($sh);
    my $sibit = 1 &lt;&lt; fileno($si);

    my $inbitmask = $shbit | $sibit;

    # select(readtest, writetest, exceptiontest, max wait)
    select($inbitmask, undef, undef, 0);

    if($inbitmask & $shbit) {
      # $sh is ready for read
    }

    if($inbitmask & $sibit) {
      # $si is ready for read
    }

</pre>
Done in a loop, several sources of input - perhaps the network, a GUI interface, pipes connected to other processes - could all be managed. The last argument to <i>select()</i> is typically 0 or <i>undef</i>, though it is sometimes other numbers. If it is <i>undef</i>, <i>select()</i> will wait indefinately for input. If it is 0, <i>select()</i> will return immediately, input ready or not. Any other number is a number of seconds to wait, floating point numbers accepted. As soon as a any monitored input or output handle becomes ready, <i>select()</i> will return.  <i>select()</i> doesn't return a value in the normal sense: it motifies the bit mask, turning off any bits that correspond to <i>fileno()</i> bit positions that aren't ready. Each bit that we set must be tested to see if it is still on. If it is, that filehandle is ready for read or write. Filehandles that we want to monitor for read are passed as a bitmask in the first argument position of <i>select()</i>. The second argument of <i>select()</i> is the filehandles to monitor for write, and the third, for exceptions. <br><br>
<pre>
    if($inbitmask & $sibit) {
      $si->process_input();
    }

</pre>
Filehandles may be blessed into classes <a href="#footnote25">[25]</a>,  and then methods called to handle the event where input becomes available for read. This is easy to implement, simple, and sane - to implement. Using it is another story. <br><br>

  sub process_input() {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->read(...);
  }

</pre>
Each access must promptly return for other handles to be served. This is a big requirement. Unheaded, a user interface could repeatedly cause network traffic to time out, or one unresponsive process reading on a pipe to lock up the process writing on the pipe - see <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PerlGotchas">PerlGotchas</a> for more. These cases are more numerous and insideous than thread CPU starvation issues.  <br><br>
To effectively cope with not having a return stack of its own, each line of processing associated with an IO handle must take pains to keep track of where it was in its code, what is doing, and what it expects to do next. See <a href="#StatePattern">StatePattern</a> for an implementation of this and more discussion. <br><br>

Solution: Don't change when you can append updated information, and never leave data in an indeterminate state. <br><br>

To use, do something like:  <br><br>
<pre>
  use Xfor;
  my $hash = new Xfor;
  $hash->open('carparts.nvp');

  # read:

  $hash->get('carparts.nvp', 'xj-11', 'muffler');   # which muffler does the xj-11 use?

  # write:

  $hash->set('cartparts.nvp', 'xj-11', 'muffler', 'c3p0');

  # then later:

  $hash->close('carparts.nvp');

  # or... 

  $hash->recreate('carparts.nvp');


</pre>
Xfor.pm reads files from beginning to end, and goes with the last value discovered.  This lets us write by kind-of journeling: we can just tack updated information on to the end. we can also regenerate the file with only the latest data, upon request. Since we read in all data, we're none too speedy. Reading is as slow as Storable or the like, but writing is much faster. <br><br>
Data is written to the end of the file when the <i>->close()</i> method is called. There are no fixed record lengths. We never go into the middle of a file and try to insert data. We don't move and regenerate the file unless explicitly  asked to, and we only do that to keep it from getting too large. <br><br>
A tied-hash interface could be provided for persistant journaled storage without the clumbsy method interface. If a single value is needed, the entire file need not be read into memory - this case could be optimized. We use the vertical bar as a field deliminator - this is bound to cause problems unless either we escape them in strings, in which case the escape character must also be escaped when it occurs normally. Taking a BinaryClean<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?BinaryClean">+</a> approach is usually better than trying to escape things: include an explicit length and then use <i>read()</i> to read exactly that much data.  <br><br>
<a href="#ExportingPattern">ExportingPattern</a> talks about creating a single default instance that can be used without explicitly naming an object, only using the correct methods. <br><br>
This example should also take a few arguments to the constructor and pass them to each method so that a default file or default file and default record can be specified. It isn't useful as a module as it stands, but  illustrates the trade off between read time and write time that simple journaling approaches offer. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="WebAuthentication"><h2>WebAuthentication</h2><br> <br><br>
<li> New-User Registration <br><br>
Do you want to send them an email with a generated password in it to validate their email address? <br><br>
<li> User Validation <br><br>
<ul><li> .htaccess
</ul><br><br>
Suited for a small number of users, each of which has the same permissions. User creation and maintenance involves modifying the file directly. <br><br>
<ul><li> Cookies
</ul><br><br>
There are lots of formulas, but the winning one is: issue a cookie with an authorization token. Store the token in the database along with an expiration time seperate of the cookie. The token should be random generated and completely seperate from the password but handed out when the password is validated. This is the best case; if your porn addicted friend comes over and uses your computer, and steals your cookies.txt file when you aren't looking, cookies generated this way can't be used to discover the username or password used. The password change form could be used as a loophole though: if the token is still valid  and the password change script doesn't explicitly double check the old password before  letting you change it, a new password could be put in place for the account without your friend knowing the old one. It is best to always check that the user knows the old password before allowing them to change it to avoid this problem. <br><br>
Our example here doesn't do any of this. It merely hands out cookies that contain the literal username and password. Our passwords aren't stored encrypted in the database. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?OneWayHash">OneWayHash</a> for an example of that. The examples are at the bottom of this section. <br><br>
<ul><li> Munged links.
</ul><br><br>
Sometimes users don't have cookies turned on. In this case, you've got two options: tracking them by IP and including the session ID in all forms and links. Tracking users by IP is error prone, since entire companies traffic is often filtered through a firewall that uses network address translation to present all of the internal computers traffic as coming from one IP address. Inexpensive home "modem sharing" devices do exactly the same thing. Munging links requires that the session ID be constantly passed back to the scripts at every link or form: <br><br>
<pre>
  # go out of our way to include sid=$sid:

  print qq{&lt;a href="otherprog.cgi?foo=bar&color=red&sid=$sid">Go To Otherprog&lt;/a>};

  print qq{
    &lt;form action="anotherprog.cgi" method="post"> 
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="sid" value="$sid">
      Enter answer: &lt;input type="text" name="answer">&lt;br>
      &lt;input type="submit">
    &lt;/form>
  };
  
</pre>
Forgetting to do this in even one link or form causes the site to forget any and all information about a user as soon as they click it. Additionally, since the sessionid is part of the HTML, it lives on in the browser cache. For this reason, session id tokens should be expired after a period of time by the server. This means having the server simply record the date that it issued a session id number and refusing to honor it after a period of time has elapsed, forcing the user to re-login. <br><br>
One dirty little trick that a programmer friend of mine (okey, it was me) used once (okey, several times) on mod_perl sites was having the handler parse .html files with embedded perl, and munge all of the links - from both the .html and the perl output: <br><br>
<pre>
  $oOo =~ s/&lt;(a|frame)([^>]*) (src|href)=(['"]?)(?!javascript)([^'"]+\.htm)(l)?(\?)?([^'">]*)?\4(?=\w|>>)/&lt;$1$2 $3="$5$6\?$8\&sid=$sid"/ig;
    
  # $1: 'a' or 'frame'
  # $2: any random name=value pairs (exa 'name="mainFrame"')
  # $3: 'src' or 'href'
  # $4: any begin qouting character, be it ' or "
  # $5: whatever.htm
  # $6: optional 'l'
  # $7: optional '?' (discarded)
  # $8: optional cgi get string
  # $9: 0-width lookahead assertion: > or space isn't matched but is looked for
    
</pre>
<li> Other Stuff <br><br>
You prolly want to plan from the beginning to have a bunch of small .cgi scripts instead of one huge monolithic one... so you'll want to make a sort of "validateuser.pm" file and "use validateuser.pm;" at the top of each .cgi.  <br><br>
<hr><br><br>
<pre>
  # Sample validateuser.pm:
  
  use CGI;
  use <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CGI/">CGI</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=CGI::Carp">Carp</a> qw/fatalsToBrowser/;
  use DBI;
  
  use lib "/home/scott/cgi-bin/DBD";
  
  BEGIN {
  
    $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:Pg:dbname=sexcantwait;host=localhost;port=5432", 'scott', 'pass')
      or die $DBI::errstr;
  }
  
  use <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/TransientBaby/">TransientBaby</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=TransientBaby::Postgres">Postgres</a>;
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TransientBaby">TransientBaby</a>;
  
  createquery('validateuser', qq{
    select   <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UserID">UserID</a> as userid
    from     Users
    where    Name = [:username:]
    and      Pass = [:userpass:]
  });
  
  sub validated {
    $userid = -1;
    my $sid=CGI::cookie(-name=>"sid");
    return 0 unless $sid;
    ($username, $userpass) = split /,/, $sid;
    validateuser();
    return $userid == -1 ? 0 : 1;
  }
  
  sub is_guest {
    return $username =~ /^guest/;
  }

  sub offer_login {
    print qq{
      Sorry, you aren't logged in. Please enter your name and password:&lt;br>&lt;br>
      &lt;form action="login.cgi" method="post">
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="action" value="login">
        User name: &lt;input type="text" name="username">&lt;br>
        Password: &lt;input type="password" name="password">&lt;br>
        Are you a new user? &lt;input type="checkbox" name="newuser">&lt;br>
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Log in">&lt;br>
      &lt;/form>
    };
    exit 0;
  }
  
  1;
  
</pre>
Instead of declaring a package and using Exporter, we're merely continuing to operate in the namespace of the module that invoked us. The methods we define - validated(), validateuser(), offer_login() and is_guest() show up in their package, ready for use. As a side effect, we're using CGI.pm and DBI.pm on behalf of our caller, letting us list all of the modules we want in only one place, rather than in every .cgi script. This module could be used with: <br><br>
<pre>
  print qq{Content-type: text/html\n\n}; 
  use validateuser;
  validated() or offer_login();

  # rest of the script here, for users only

</pre>
offer_login() never returns once we call it. It handles exiting the script for us. <br><br>
<hr><br><br>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl

  # example login/create user script that uses validateuser.pm.
  # this should be named login.cgi to match the form in validateuser.pm, unless of course
  # that form's action is changed.
  
  use validateuser;
  
  createquery('userexists', qq{
    select count(*) as num
    from   Users
    where  Users.Name = [:name:]
  });
  
  createquery('createuser', qq{
    insert into Users
    (Name, Pass, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?CreationIP">CreationIP</a>)
    values
    ([:name:], [:pass:], [:creationip:])

These examples make heavy use of my <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TransientBaby">TransientBaby</a>.pm module. That module creates  recursive routines that communicate using global variables - ick. I need to change that, and then this example. Then I'll put that code up. XXX. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="WebScraping"><h2>WebScraping</h2><br> <br><br>
"WebScraping" is extracting information from the Web. Picking out information from web pages and using it in an appliction is said to be scraping the data. Usually refers to harvesting live data feeds or minipulating specific applications via the Web. Also known as <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebMining">WebMining</a> or <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebHarvesting">WebHarvesting</a>, especially when one type of information is sought across the entire web.  <br><br>
Use LWP to fetch web pages using URLs. See example HTML parser in <a href="#RunAndReturnSuccessor">RunAndReturnSuccessor</a>. <br><br>

  my $accessor;
  my %opts;

  my @table;
  my $tablerow;
  my $tablecol = -1;

  parse_html($document, sub {

    $accessor = shift;
    %opts = @_;

    if($opts{tag} eq 'tr') {

      # create a new, blank array entry on the end of @table
      $tablerow++; $table[$tablerow] = [];
      $tablecol = 0;

    } elsif($opts{tag} eq 'td') {

      # store the text following the &lt;td> tag in $table[][]
      $table[$tablerow][$tablecol] = $accessor->('trailing');
      $tablecol++;

    }

  });

</pre>
I've gone out of my way to avoid the nasty push @{$table[-1]} construct as I don't feel like looking at it right now. <i>$tablerow</i> and <i>$tablecol</i> could be avoided otherwise. This code watches for HTML table tags and uses those to build a 2 dimentional array. <br><br>
Data taken from a database and presented in HTML tables was normalized in the database, but is denormalized for display. When it is denormalized, data from several relational tables is presented as one table. In this case, there may be different views of the data, each driven by a differenet query or different query parameters. See <a href="#ObjectsAndRelationalDatabaseSystems">ObjectsAndRelationalDatabaseSystems</a> for more on normalization. <br><br>
If we're putting the harvested data back into a database to report on, it suits us to reconstruct some structure to it.  <br><br>
<pre>
  select table1.a, table2.b, table3.c
  from table1, table2, table3
  where table1.id = table2.id
  and   table2.param = table3.id
  order by table1.a, table2.b, table3.c

</pre>
We can't recover the <i>id</i> or <i>param</i> fields from the output of this query, but we can generate our own.  <br><br>
Joining between three tables flattens the extracted data down to one.  This sort of joining has a tell-tale pattern in its output, in that the columns appear to count. The first <i>n</i> columns are from <i>tablea</i>, second so many from <i>tableb</i>, and so on.  <br><br>
<pre>
  aaa
  aab
  aac
  aad
  aba
  aca
  ada
  baa
  bab
  (And so on...)

</pre>
Add this clause to the if statement in the sub passed to parse_html() above, remembering to declare the introduced variables in the correct scope: <br><br>
<pre>
    } elsif($opts{tag} eq '/tr') {

      if(!$tablerow or $table[$tablerow][0] ne $table[$tablerow-1][0]) {
        $dbh->execute("insert into tablea (a) values (?)", $table[$tablerow][0]);
        $table_a_id = $dbh->insert_id();
        # else $table_a_id will retain its value from the last pass
      }

      if(!$tablerow or $table[$tablerow][1] ne $table[$tablerow-1][1]) {
        $dbh->execute("insert into tableb (b, id) values (?, ?)", $table[$tablerow][1], $table_a_id);
        $table_b_id = $dbh->insert_id();
        # else $table_b_id will retain its value from the last pass
      }

      if(!$tablerow or $table[$tablerow][2] ne $table[$tablerow-1][2]) {
        $dbh->execute("insert into tablec (c) values (?, ?)", $table[$tablerow][1], $table_b_id);
        $table_c_id = $dbh->insert_id();
        # else $table_c_id will retain its value from the last pass
      }

    }
      
</pre>
This code depends on <i>$dbh</i> being a properly initialized database connection. I'm using <i>->insert_id()</i>, a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MySQL">MySQL</a> extention, for clarity. Unlike the previous  code, this code is data-source specific. Only a human looking at the data can deturmine how best to break the single table up into normalized, relational tables. We're assuming three tables, each having one column, aside from the <i>id</i> field. Assuming this counting pattern, we insert records into <i>tablec</i> most often, linking them to the most recently inserted <i>tableb</i> record. <i>tableb</i> is inserted into less frequently, and when it is, the record refers to the most recently inserted record in <i>tablea</i>. When a record is inserted into <i>tablea</i>, it isn't linked to any other records.  <br><br>

    $data = &lt;FH>;
    close FH;
  }

</pre>
Pros: Everyone seems to know this one. Reads in entire file in one gulp without an array intermediary. Cons: <i>$data</i> cannot be declared with <i>my</i> because we have to create a block to localize the record seperator in. Ugly. <br><br>
<b>A Short and Sweet Idiom</b> <br><br>
<pre>
  @ARGV = ($file);
  my $data = join '', &lt;>;

</pre>
Pros: Short. Sweet. Cons: Clobbers <i>@ARGV</i>, poor error handling, inefficient for large files. <br><br>
<b>Shell-Holdout Idiom</b> <br><br>
<pre>
  my $data = `cat $file`;

</pre>
Pros: Very short. Makes sense to <i>sh</i> programmers. Cons: Secure problem -  shell commands may be buried in filenames. Creates an additional process - poor performance for files small and large. No error handling.  Is not portable. <br><br>
<b>Read/Sysread Idiom</b> <br><br>
<pre>
  open my $fh, '&lt;', $file or die $!;
  read $fh, my $data, -s $fh or die $!;
  close $fh;

</pre>
Pros: Good error handling. Reasonably short. Efficient. Doesn't misuse Perl-isms to save space. Uses lexical scoping for everything. Cons: None.  <br><br>
<b>Mmap Idiom</b> <br><br>
<pre>
  use <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Sys/">Sys</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Sys::Mmap">Mmap</a>;
  new Mmap my $data, -s $file, $file or die $!;

</pre>
Pros: Very fast random access for large files as sectors of the file aren't read into memory until actually referenced. Changes to the variable propogate back to the file making read/write, well, cool. Cons: Requires use of an external module such as <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Sys/">Sys</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Sys::Mmap">Mmap</a>, file cannot easily be grown. Difficult for non-Unix-C programmers to understand. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ConfigFile"><h2>ConfigFile</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: Using <b>require</b> to read config files is handy, but many people feel  they've outgrown using it, so they write elaborate modules to handle configuration. <br><br>
When: You're reading configuration data from a file that users can edit and have written back to disc. <br><br>
<pre>
  require 'config.pl';

</pre>
We've all seen it a million times. It's as old as Perl itself. You make a little  Perl program that does nothing but assign values to variables. Users can "easily" edit the file to change the values without having to wade through your source  code. It is extremely easy to read configuration files of this format, and you  can store complex datastructures in there, along with comments. <br><br>
Configuration is one of those sore spots that the limits of are continuously  pushed by users. Most Perl programmers give up their old config.pl when  requirements specify a spiffy Web or Tk interface for users to change settings. No more!  <br><br>
<pre>
  # config.pl:

  $config = {
    widgets=>'max',
    gronkulator=>'on',
    magic=>'more'
  };

  # configTest.pl:

  use <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Data/">Data</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Data::Dumper">Dumper</a>;
  require 'config.pl';

  $config->{gronkulator} = 'no, thanks';

  open my $conf, '>config.pl' or die $!;
  print $conf <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Data/">Data</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Data::Dumper">Dumper</a>->Dump($config);
  close $conf;

</pre>
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Data/">Data</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Data::Dumper">Dumper</a>.pm comes with Perl, and can even store entire objects. In fact, it can store networks of object. <br><br>
Security may be a concern. If you don't want Perl in configuration files to gain the priviledge of your program, use the Safe module or <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UseOps">UseOps</a>. If the program is running as a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DaemonProcess">DaemonProcess</a> as the superuser, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UseOps">UseOps</a> or the Safe module. If the program is setuid and the people running it don't have access to edit it, use the Safe module or <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UseOps">UseOps</a>.  <br><br>
<b>Finding the Config or Data Directory</b> <br><br>
Something that is reasonably portable between Unix and Win is to look for an environment variable telling you where to go for the data. <i>msconfig.exe</i> lets you set startup environment variables and a lot of unix programs (cvs, postgres, etc) use environment variables to find their data if it isn't passed on the command line. Polluting the environment in Unix is considered bad form by many, and dropping something in <i>/etc</i> isn't portable, so go fish. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ErrorReporting"><h2>ErrorReporting</h2><br> <br><br>
<b>Use die()</b> <br><br>
Avoid temptation to write a new death-handler and call it by name in  place of <i>die()</i>: <br><br>

  sub barf {

    exit 1;
  }

  barf("number too large") if($number > $too_large);

</pre>
<i>die()</i> has a useful default behavior that depends on no external modules, but can easily be overriden with a handler to do more complex cleanup, reporting, and so on. If you don't use <i>die()</i>, you can't easily localize which handler is used in a given scope. <br><br>

<b>Die Early, Die Often</b> <br><br>
Catch errors before you get far away, or unrelated code will appear to malfunction, as a horrible form of <a href="#ActionAtADistance">ActionAtADistance</a>. In the process of debugging, you're going to need to insert lots of tests anyway, so why not do it neatly from the beginning and integrate it into your program? When the program is in production is when error reporting is most needed, if users or logs are going to communicate the nature of the problem to you to be fixed. See <a href="#RunAndReturnSuccessor">RunAndReturnSuccessor</a> and <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MementoPattern">MementoPattern</a> for a description of checkpointing an application to recover from otherwise fatal errors. <i>eval { }</i> is used for trapping errors - see <a href="#AssertPattern">AssertPattern</a>. <br><br>
<pre>
  open my $f, 'file.txt' or die $!;

</pre>
<i>or die</i> should litterally dot your code. Thats how you communicate to Perl and your readership that it is not okey for the statement to silently fail. Most languages make such error geeration default; in Perl, you must request it. This is no excuse for allowing all errors to sneak by silently.  <br><br>
Should you not have the constitution to speckle your code with <i>or die</i> clauses, or you're a minimalist, striving for elegance, there is a solution: <br><br>
<pre>
  # from the Fatal.pm perldoc:

  use Fatal qw(open close);

  sub juggle { . . . }
  import Fatal 'juggle';

</pre>
<i>Fatal.pm</i> will place wrappers around your methods or Perl built in methods, changing their default behavior to throw an error. A module which does heavy file IO on a group of files need not check the return value of each and every <i>open()</i>, <i>read()</i>, <i>write()</i>, and <i>close()</i>. Only at key points - on method entry, entry into  worker functions, etc - do you need to handle error conditions. This is a more reasonable request, one easily acheived. Should an error occur and be cought, the text of the error message will be in <i>$@</i>. <br><br>
<pre>
  use Fatal qw(open close read write flock seek print);

  sub update_data_file {
    my $this = shift;
    my $data = shift;
    my $record;
    local *filename = \$this->{filename};
    local *record = \$this->{record};

    eval {

      open my $f, '>+', $filename;
      flock $f, 4;
      seek $f, $record, 0; 
      print $f, $data;
      close $f;

    };

    return 0 if $@;   # update failed
    return 1;         # success

  }

</pre>
Alternatively, rather than using <i>eval { }</i> ourselves, following <a href="#AssertPattern">AssertPattern</a>, we could trust that someone at some point installed a <i>__DIE__</i> handler. The most recently installed <i>local</i> handler gets to try to detangle the web.  <br><br>
<pre>
  sub generate_report {
    local $SIG{__DIE__} = { 
      print "Whoops, report generation failed. Tell your boss it was my fault. Reason: ", @_;
    }
    foreach my $i ($this->get_all_data()) {
      $data->update_data_file($i);
    }
  }

  sub checkpoint_app {
    local $SIG{__DIE__} = { 
      print "Whoops, checkpoint failed. Correct problem and save your data. Reason: ", @_;
    }
    $data->update_data_file($this->get_data());
  }

</pre>
Using <i>local</i> scoped handlers this way allows you to provide context-sensitive recoverory, or atleast diagnostics, when errors are thrown. This is easy to do and all that is required to take full advantage of <i>Fatal.pm</i>. <pre>
 
</pre>
<i>Fatal.pm</i> was written by Lionel.Cons@cern.ch with prototype updates by Ilya  Zakharevich ilya@math.ohio-state.edu. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ExtensibilityPattern"><h2>ExtensibilityPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: You wish to provide not only a framework but an environment for certain kind of task. Instead of your code being used by other code, your code will use other code on the fly. <br><br>
A major complaint against GUIs is that they make it difficult to script repetitive tasks. Command line interfaces are difficult for humans to work with (unless the human in question is quite used to it). Neither give rich access to the API of a program. A well designed program is a few lines of Perl in the main program that use a number of modules. This makes it easier to reuse the program logic in other programs. Complex programs that build upon existing parts benefit from this, without question. How about the other case - a small script meant to automate some task? This requires that the script have knowledge about the  structure of the application - it must know how to assemble the modules, initialize them, and so on. It is forced to work with aspects of the API that it almost certainly isn't concerned with. This is a kind of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractionInversion">AbstractionInversion</a> - where something abstract is graphed onto something concrete, or something simple is grafted onto the top of something complex. It would make more sense in this case for the application to implement a  sort of <a href="#VisitorPattern">VisitorPattern</a>, and allow itself to be passed whole, already assembled, to another spat of code that knows how to perform specific  operations on it. This lends itself to the sequential nature of the  script: the user defined extention could be a series of simple calls: <pre>
  
  pacakge <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UserExtention">UserExtention</a>1;

  # we are expected to have a "run_macro" method

  sub run_macro {
    my $this = shift;
    my $app = shift;

    $app->place_cursor(0, 0);
    $app->set_color('white');
    $app->draw_circle(radius=>1);
    $app->set_color('red');
    $app->draw_circle(radius=>2);
    # and so on... make a little bull's eye

    return 1;
  }

</pre>
The main application could prompt the user for a module to load, or load all of the modules in a plug-ins directory, then make them available as menu items in an "extentions" menu. When one of the extentions are select from the menu, a reference to the application - or a <a href="#FacadePattern">FacadePattern</a> providing an interface to it - is passed to the run_macro() method of an instance of that package. <br><br>
Many applications will have users that want to do simple automation without being bothered to learn even a little Perl (horrible but true!). Some applications (like Mathematica, for instance) will provide  functionality that doesn't cleanly map to Perl. In this case, you'd want to be able to parse expressions and minipulate them. In these cases, a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LittleLanguage">LittleLanguage</a> may be just the thing.  <br><br>
A <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LittleLanguage">LittleLanguage</a> is a small programming language created specifically for the task at hand. It can be similar to other languages. Having something clean and simple specifically targetted at the problem can be better solution than throwing an overpowered language at it. Just by neglecting unneeded features, user confusion is reduced.  <br><br>
<pre>
    place_cursor(0, 0)
    set_color(white)
    draw_circle(radius=1)
    set_color(red)
    draw_circle(radius=2)

</pre>
A few options exist: we can compile this directly to Perl bytecode using B::Generate (suitable for integrating legacy languages without performance loss), or we can munge this into Perl and <b>eval</b> it. Lets turn it into Perl. <br><br>

  eval $perl; if($@) {
     # display diagnostic information to user
  }

</pre>
We're using the \G regex metacharacter that matches where the last global regex on that string left off. That lets us take off several small bites from the string rather than having to do it all in one big bite. The flags on the end of the regex are: <br><br>
<li> g - global - needed for the \G token to work <li> c - not sure, but it makes g work <li> s - substring - treat the entire string as one string. Newlines become regular characters and match whitespace. <br><br>
Out of context, the string "xyzzy" could be either a parameter or the name of a method to call. The solution is simply to keep track of context: that is where $state comes in. Every time we find something, we update $state to indicate what class of thing would be valid if it came next. After  we find a function name and an opening paranthesis, either a hash style parameter or a single, lone parameter, or else a close paranthesis would be valid. We aren't even looking for the start of another function *. After a parameter, we're looking for either the close paranthesis or another parameter. <br><br>
<li> Though perhaps we should be. If changed this in our code, it would allow us to nest function calls inside of each other. We would have to track our level of nesting if we wanted to report errors if there were too many or too few right-paranthesis. Exercise left for the reader. <br><br>
Every time we match something, we append a Perl-ized version of exactly the same thing onto $perl. All of this is wrapped in a package and method declaration. Finally, $perl is evaluated. The result of evaluating should be to make this new package available to our code, ready to be called. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="CutAndPasteProgramming"><h2>CutAndPasteProgramming</h2><br> <br><br>
When programming, you take a generic algorithm and customize it for a task.  Sometimes you have a copy of an implementation of that algorithm laying around  that you can copy. OO tells us not to do that. Someone once said, "If you're  going to make a mistake, make it in a big way". Keeping one sacred copy that  must be correct could certainly accomplish that. However, it makes it possible  to fix a problem once instead of having it spread around the code. Having code  replicated is a huge commitment. You're banking that nothing is wrong with it,  that your program will never change how the data it works on is represented,  and that people like looking at endless permutations of a single piece of code.  <br><br>
Object Orientation proposes to eliminate this. The act of separating your  program into objects creates a ripe new area for endless duplication: sequences of setting, querying, and passing data. A common situation: <br><br>
<pre>
  $money = $player->query_money();
  if($player->query_max_money() &lt; $x + $payout) {
    $player->set_money($money + $payout); 
    $nickels_on_floor = 0;
  } else {
      $nickels_on_floor =  $money + $payout - $player->query_max_money();
      $player->set_money($player->query_max_money());
  }

</pre>
No matter which way we make the set_money() function work, we're doomed. If it  enforces a ceiling, then we have to query again to see if the ceiling was  enforced. If it doesn't enforce a ceiling, then we have to check each and every time we access the value and enforce it ourselves. The result is one or two of  these sequences of logic will get strewn around the program. The problem is  that the client needs something slightly more complex than the server is  prepared to provide. We could, and perhaps should, make the object we're  calling, $player, return an array, including success or failure, how much  money actually changed hands, how much more they could carry. This would go  with the approach of providing way more information than could ever be needed.  This leads to bloated code and logic that we aren't sure whether or not is  actually being used, leading to untested code going into production and  becoming a time-bomb for the future, should anyone actually start using it.  Less dramatically, we could modify the target object to return just one more  piece of information when we realize we need it. This leads to a sort of  feature envy, where the server is going out of its way to provide things in  terms of a certain clients expectations, causing an API that is geared towards  a particular client and incomprehensible to all else. Also, there is temptation to write something like: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Util;

</pre>
Beware of Utility, Helper, Misc, etc packages. They collect orphan code. The  pressure to move things out of them is very low, as they all seem to fit by  virtue of not fitting anywhere else. They grow indefinitely in size because the class of things that don't seem to belong anywhere is very large. The effect  snowballs as the growth of other objects is stymied while the "Utility" package booms. <br><br>
Snafus like this cause the number of accessors to grow to accommodate all of  the permutations of accessing the data. You'll often see a set_ function, a  query_ or get_ function, and add_ function, for each value we encapsulate. <br><br>
<pre>
  package Casino;
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>; <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/ImplicitThis/">ImplicitThis</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=ImplicitThis::imply">imply</a>();

  sub pay_out {

    # this method would go in $player, since it is mostly concerned with $player's variables,
    # but we don't want to clutter up $player's package, and we don't know if anyone else
    # will ever want to use this code.

    my $player = shift;
    my $payout = shift;

    my $money = $player->query_money();
    if($player->query_max_money() &lt; $money + $cost) {
      $player->set_money($money + $payout); 
      $nickels_on_floor = 0;
  } else {
      $nickels_on_floor =  $money + $payout - $player->query_max_money();
      $player->set_money($player->query_max_money());
    }
  }

Associating methods with our client object that reasonably belong in the server object ($player, in our case), isn't always the worst solution. In fact, if you put them there and leave them until it is clear that they are needed elsewhere, you'll find that either they are globally applicable, they only apply to this  client, they apply to a special case of the client, or they apply to a special  case of the server. <br><br>
1. Applies only to this particular client: Leave the server's accessors in the client, in this case, Casino. 2. Nearly every client can benefit from this code: Put the logic in the server, in this case, $player. 3. Applies to a special case of clients: Consider a Facade for $player. Not worth it? Toss up between #1 and #2. 3. Applies to a special case of servers: Subclass $player's package. <br><br>
Its okay to do it "wrong". Each new thing that gets built will give you more  and more insight into how things really need to be able to work. The important  thing is to continue to incorporate these lessons into the code, to keep the  code in line with reality, and never be afraid of breaking your code. If you're afraid of breaking your code in name of making it better, it has you hostage.  If you're afraid of breaking it because you think it'll take too long to fix it to work again after the change, it has already grown rigid, and only frequently breaking and fixing it will allow it to regain its flexibility. Take Jackie  Chan, for instance. Having broken countless bones, he's only gotten stronger,  braver, and apparently, more skilled at walking on a broken leg, more  knowledgeable about his limits, and adept at healing. Alternatively, if you're  afraid of subtle bugs creeping in undetected, you've got murky depths syndrome.  Perhaps a lot of it is poorly understood Lava Flow code, that was laid down  once, built on top of, and has become permanent for it. Reading through the  dark murky code is a good start. A pass now and then keeps the possibilities  and implications fresh in your mind. However, this is time consuming and will  ultimately miss implications. There is no substitute for knowledge of the code, and neither is there substitute for testing. There is a special class of code  where every bit of logic is exersized every execution. Mathematical modeling  applications that work on large, well understood, datasets fit this  description. Any subtle bug would give dramatic bias in the output as soon as  the buggy program were run. Normal programs doesn't have this luxury - their  bugs lurk for ages, possibly until maintaince headaches dictate it be abandoned and rewritten. We can't understand everything in a large program, but we can  contrived data sets and test applications that work out every feature of our  module. Writing artificial applications that use our modules, and coming up  with bizarrely improbably-in-every-way datasets simulates the "luxury" case  where all of the dark murky depths are used every run, in our case, every test  run. The only time dark murky depths and Lava Flow code, the code most in need  of a refactor, can be attacked is when we have a definitive method for  discovering whether or not we've broken it. "Measure twice, cut once". If  you're anything like me, you like flying by the seat of your pants. If you go  to the movies or watch the tele, you know that every fighter pilot struggles  with this issue: do I trust my intuition and wing it, or do I go by the book?  Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star without that damn useless targeting  computer. The architects that built skyscrapers certainly have to think outside of the box, so to speak, to come up with techniques and ideas for building  beyond the bounds of what is believed possible, but no one would trust an  architect that couldn't back up his gut instincts with cold, hard math.  Solution? Code with your heart, but be the first to know when you make the  inevitable wrong guess. Write seat of your pants code, but write first class  scientific tests. <br><br>

"If I use the Object Oriented features, I must be benefiting from them". <br><br>
OO is no silver bullet. It isn't a cure all and it isn't impossible to do more harm than good with it. Its a good indication that something has gone wrong if it is adding complexity rather than removing. Remember, keep it simple. When it becomes clear how to refactor your code, do so then, not before. <br><br>
Can interchangeable objects be used interchangeably? Can one object be replaced with several objects? If not, consider adding a common Interface Type to the like objects, and creating an Abstract Factory to create and return the correct one for any given situation. Think of saving files using one of many filters. <br><br>
Are objects being used purely to hold values? You've probably got one or two big fat Big Ball Of Mud objects. Start moving logic out into the package that contains the data it most closely identifies with. Insert shims to keep everything running, that delegate the method call to the object, if you must, and experiment with removing the shim over time. If nothing else, this sets a precedent, and new code can be written immediately in the new, correct way, rather than more and more code accumulating using the old, ugly approach. <br><br>
Can you remove an object from the system without breaking every other object? If not, they are too interdependent, with very few exceptions. Even with the Microsoft Windows operating system, something like "the registry" sounded like a great idea at first. Any program, as well as the operating system, could store configuration and run time data in a central database. In practice, it creates a single point of failure, frequently sustaining damage that causes the entire system to need to be restored from backup or reinstalled. The file grows too large and the operating system fails on any attempt to grow it beyond the limit of the max file size. Windows was designed with the register being a core, unchanging idea, but in retrospect, it may have been better if it weren't an absolute. Examining your code for objects which absolutely cannot be removed provides great insight into over dependence. If every object is dependent on every other object, object orientation is doing nothing for you. If any object can be removed with minimal damage to the overall structure, you have something healthy and organic. <br><br>

Procedural code converted to OO lends itself to one main object with lot of little objects hung off of it.

<i>A BIG BALL OF MUD is haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape and bailing wire, spaghetti code jungle. We've all seen them. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated. The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined. If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PatternLanguageOfProgramDesign">PatternLanguageOfProgramDesign</a> 4 <br><br>

The problem with retrofits is they are typically hastily done and never improved before the next story is built. They come under an immediate pressing concern  that overwhelms any reasonable ability to think of the future. Indeed, the  future won't exist at all for the project if the retrofit isn't done. Not even  in Las Vegas are floors built so aggressively.  <br><br>
Reguardless of whether you're in the Windows camp or the Unix camp, you're using  an operating system built for a 16 bit system that has been retrofit, but never actually completely rewritten.  Other operating systems have equally as interesting stories - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MacOS">MacOS</a> 1 through 9 were written for a 32 bit native address space, but memory protection was retrofit,  while Unix was written for a 16 bit address space and retrofit for 32, but  incorporated memory management from the beginning. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> was originally  Tripos, but was written in BCPL, a language that had one data unit - the  machine word - making the conversion to a 32 bit processor and system bizarrely easy, while making mundane programming tasks bizarrely painful. C later grew  out of BCPL, where it cleaned up the syntax, introduced subscripts on arrays of different sized units of memory, then later structs, unions, and countless other modern marvels - but all of this is neither here nor there.  <br><br>
<i>Refactor mercilessly</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode">RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode</a> <br><br>
Systems can effectively be adapted, and in order to build very far at all, you almost have to adapt an existing system. Adaption cannot be sustained without time spent making fundamental changes - see <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvariantsArentAlwaysConstants">InvariantsArentAlwaysConstants</a> - but fundamentally it is a better investment to maintain and adapt existing systems rather than rewrite them. Most spectacular software industry failures arose from failure to maintain systems followed by an attempt to rewrite them from scratch. Most successes can trace their code back to the 1970s: The SAS system, Unix, DB2, and Signaling System 7, for example. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?JoelOnSoftware">JoelOnSoftware</a> states that it takes 10 years to write a program. I'd place that as a minimum. Most software starting life in the 1970s is now rock solid, mature, and portable. Most programs that started life in the mid-1980s are still having growing pains, stability problems, and their owners can't bare the expense of porting them. <br><br>
Perl allows you to quickly create applications. Perl itself could be considered a <a href="#BigBallOfMud">BigBallOfMud</a>, with complexity oozing out every pore. Perl has been around longer than 10 years. A large part of the code reuse of a script is from the interpreter itself. Writing an interpereter is one way of writing an API for code reuse. This gives significant lead time on small scripts, but growing and changing applications hit a ceiling even quicker because of this accelerated start. Perl scripts quickly reach the point where they need to be detangled. <br><br>

No one understands it, so no one refactors it. Just as it is almost impossible to untangle a plate of spaghetti, code with no visible structure and no logical structure is daunting. Structured Programming contributed to the world the idea that the code should visibly reflect its logical structure: this was the birth of indenting. Previously, a goto would bounce back a few lines in flow, and another one somewhere in the middle would bounce you past the last goto. <br><br>
<pre>
  10 let a=a+1
  20 if a > 10 then goto 50
  30 print a:print "\n"
  40 goto 10
  50 stop

  foreach my $a (1..10) {
    print "$a\n";
  }

</pre>
Despite the systematic banishment of these languages *, people still find ways to write code that has this problem on a large scale: <br><br>
<li> This first example is BASIC. BASIC still lives on today. What gives? Well, its been retrofit. <br><br>
1. Side effects: Each method called seems to do countless unrelated unexpected things, making the normal flow difficult to understand or discover. When writing new code, it is often impossible to reuse existing code because of the unfathomed grouping of unrelated tasks. <br><br>
2. Dark heart: The heart of each routine, object, module, etc is buried somewhere deep in its bowels, poorly or not marked, and reached through an obscure path, kind of like an Egyptian pyramid. <br><br>
3. Ransom transaction: Data is communicated through global variables, or stashing data in some remote object. This is akin to conducting a ransom transaction by demanding that money be thrown into a dumpster in an abandoned industrial complex to be picked up by someone who will presumably flee and kill the kidnapee should either cops be there or money not be. This is an entirely unwholesome way to conduct a transaction.  <br><br>
4. Three cups and nut: Large amounts of unrelated things are grouped together without regard for when, how, by whom, in what order, under what conditions, or why they are used. Since they all look alike and any be used at any time, getting lost is easy. Which one actually gets used may well be a slight of hand anyway. <br><br>
5. Wheel factory: Reinventing the wheel, or stack, or program control constructs, or parameter passing mechanisms, or anything else which should be both standardized throughout a language and completely factored out of the language. This clutters the program with difficult to understand, repeated idiom. <br><br>
If Spaghetti code is needed, it can take on a life of its own. Most large projects have some legacy code that forms the heart of their project that is no longer represented by a human who wrote it.  <br><br>

XXX There is a tale of a computer manufacturer, back in the days when each vendor had their own CPU. There was a bug in their new processor, and production schedules didn't give them time to work it out. The department responsible for coding the system software (operating system) for the thing was instructed to work around it. The system software dutifully avoided tickling the bug, and documented the presence of it for anyone writing applications for the machine.  Software was ported to the machine, and unsure what to make of the bug warned end users that certain feature of the applications didn't function correctly on this machine.  <br><br>

This example applies to threaded code, but non threaded code can fall prey as well: <br><br>
<pre>

  # do something with $file here

</pre>
Both of these examples attempt to use 100% CPU resources. In the best case, you make everything sluggish. Worst case, you never release the CPU so the thing you're waiting for happens. On different systems, the results are different, too. Some threads preempt. Others never take the CPU back until you call yield() or an IO function! Writing code like this is the quickest way to make things work on some systems but not others. <br><br>
Using sleep() and yield() is an improvement. Sometimes polling is unavoidable. When you wrote the code you're waiting on, using thread::shared::semaphore lets you easily and efficiently communicate readiness between threads. Unix programs have no way of being notified when a file shows up, so polling may be the only solution: just sleep() so others can get work done. <br><br>

Objects are a good way to divide work between programmers. I've seen this  taken to an extreme: one object, per programmer. The advantage is that it  keeps your code out of the hands of other programmers. Everything in that  file is unequivocally yours. It would be modular, but it has too many methods  to be rewritten should another implementation be desired. No one would pick  that interface anyway. This happens out of haste or laziness. A programmer  is afraid moving or changing or even fixing anything will break his  increasingly fragile code. The situation perpetuates itself as the code grows  more and more fragile. Also known as a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TarPit">TarPit</a>. The last indefinately:  no one will touch them. When people set out to clean it up,  they struggle against opaque code and get sucked  in to endless cleaning. Since the code is  incomprehensible, it isn't even usable as a reference implementation. If you  think it will be quicker to reimplement a tangled web of code rather than fix  it, you're probably right. For a counter view, see <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?NeverRewriteCode">NeverRewriteCode</a>. <br><br>
If we absolutely had to break up one of these, things will get worse before  they get better. Start moving methods out, one by one, into another object.  Organize them however seems best at first - you'll learn otherwise later and  have to move stuff again, but at least then it'll be much easier to move stuff.  Each thing you move out, replace it with a stub method that delegates off the  call to where ever you've moved the method, passing as much context as it has  to. This corresponds to <a href="#MoveCollectionsOfFunctionsToObjects">MoveCollectionsOfFunctionsToObjects</a>. Eventually the God Object will contain nothing but these delegations -  good! Now the God Object is only a repository for data. We can reduce how  much of this mess of data we have to pass around by identifying data items  that can be sent to a sub object once, when that object is created. This  datum will be moved to the constructor call of that object, where that object  will remember it. See <a href="#MoveLargeDatastructuresToContainers">MoveLargeDatastructuresToContainers</a> and <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WholeObject">WholeObject</a>. Doubtlessly, many things will need to go multiple places.  In this case there is nothing to do but to two things:  <br><br>
<li> A few related bits of information: <br><br>
Pass the objects that contains the data to whichever object that wants the data.  At first, you might be sending around several large, unrelated container objects. <br><br>
<pre>
  $fooLogic->doSomething($stuff, $morestuff);

</pre>
<li> Isolated bits of information being communicated: Go through the bother of querying the data from the objects only  to pass it as arguments to the object that contains the logic. <br><br>
<pre>
  $fooLogic->doAnotherThing($stuff->querySomeThing(), $morestuff->queryOtherThing());

</pre>
Hack through this overgrown jungle long enough, and paths will emerge -  or you'll discover that there is no where to go and curse yourself for  abandoning civilization. <br><br>
Confronted with hundreds of twisty little methods that all look alike and all  use package-global data, there is one little trick for getting an object out of  them with a minimal number of keystrokes: <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DoEverythingThenSome">DoEverythingThenSome</a>;

  my $foo;
  my $bar;
  sub nastysub1 { $foo += 300; ... }
  sub nastysub2 { ... }
  ...
  sub nastysub300 { ... }

</pre>

    my $type = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    bless {
      foo => $args{foo},
      bar => $args{bar}
    }, $type;
  }

  # cut and paste directly from <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DoEverythingThenSome">DoEverythingThenSome</a>:

  sub nastysub1 { $foo += 300; ... }
  sub nastysub2 { ... }
  ...
  sub nastysub100 { ... }

</pre>
Functions that use package-global variables (eg, my variables declared at  the outer most level, the file scope) that should be migrated to objects  present one huge problem: tracking down each and every use of the variable  and changing it to a hash dereference to work with Perl's object  implementation. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a> lets you cheat your way out of this chore by  making it look all the same to you. By creating a package with a constructor  and instance data, we're opening up the possibility of one-to-many  relationships against our object: several independent instances of  <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?FooBarUlator">FooBarUlator</a> can exist at once, each with different values for $foo and $bar  and any other fields it defines. <br><br>
Data isn't always clearly associated with some routines and not others. This interdepency prevents you from moving functions and their associated global data all into one neat little isolated package. This pleads for moving related data items into a collection, in the form of an object. See <a href="#MoveLargeDatastructuresToContainers">MoveLargeDatastructuresToContainers</a>.

Have you ever attempted to disassemble a mechanical stopwatch? While most aren't as bad, many things share one interesting trait: upon removing the back cover, tiny springs, gears, cogs, plates, shafts, sprockets, ratchets and dozens of unidentifiable pieces literally fly out. The sensation of hopelessness is matched only by a programmer assigned to make changes to a program designed to work exactly one and never be changed. Building anew is far more likely than ever picking the pieces up. <br><br>
It is true that at some point things must be hardcoded. It is expected that at the very top level many objects will be created, and most passed to the constructors of others. An object shouldn't assume the right to muck with the internals of another object, much less assume its existence in the first place. Create objects at the top level of a program, package, or class, where ever the scope is above where the object is used, but not so far up it clutters an unrelated space. Pass it down via constructors. Objects will be told about the presence of each other in an organized way, and the flow of references will be traceable.  <br><br>

Placing code near the data it references, even if responsibility must be  divided, is a first step. Value objects are of course an exception: see  <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Class/">Class</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Class::Struct">Struct</a>. When two objects do talk to each, let them do so through  interfaces.

There are a few options: <br><br>

<li> <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MarkerInterface">MarkerInterface</a>: Use explicit cases to detect if a given interface is implemented by the class. This uses inheritance as a sort of capability marker. Then, the only test that needs to be made is the <i>->isa()</i> test to see if the object has the capability. See <a href="#AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a>. This is like <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MixIns">MixIns</a>, but keeps the door to delegation open. <br><br>
<li> <a href="#VisitorPattern">VisitorPattern</a>: If you must do explicit type case analysis, confine it to one place. Create an object that knows what to do with it. Normally a Visitor doesn't violate the public API of a class, but if you're going to sin this sin, thats where to do it. <br><br>

Very genereally speaking: <br><br>
<li> If two or more classes share only common data, not behavior, that data should be placed  in a container class that will be inherited by both. <li> If two or more classes have common data and behavior, they should inherit from a common subclass which in turns inherits an abstract interface. <li> If two classes share a common interface, they should inherit from a common empty base class polymorpth. <li> Any time a feature is shared, move it up as high in the inheritance hierachy as  is useful.  <li> If objects have one of many differing implementations of one set of features, implement the features in a subclass. <li> If objects differing implements from several different sets of features, delegate the different sets of features to different objects, where each delegate object knows how to implement one set of features. <br><br>

Setting a number of values then invoking the method that uses the data is a  sign of a problem. Race conditions could emerge. Old state could persist too  long. The context the method is used in is unclear, as is the context its  variables are set in. Instead, consider passing a value object, or moving the  accumulation into a value object-facade combination. Also consider turning the  object into a Value Object and passing it to a Visitor Object to perform the action.  <br><br>
An object often isn't the best place to store transient data like this as it may be left in an inconsistent state. The global nature of it can cause <a href="#ActionAtADistance">ActionAtADistance</a> problems, just as having a large number of globals can. <br><br>

Someone is doing something at the wrong time, or stomping on something they  shouldn't. Problem is, there is no way to track down who or where. Local data  isn't local, instance data isn't inside an object instance. Side effects from  innocent actions are putting the program in an unknown state. Less innocently,  communication may be intentionally going through channels, such as namespaces,  that are public by nature.  <br><br>
Decide who should be talking to whom. Move communications to events or queues  rather than shaded state. Using events, if some unexpected happens, everyone  knows right away, because they have a chance to check values and react  immediately. Using queues, at least everyone knows which way the data is flowing. <br><br>

Problem: We've moved things up to the superclass where they are most useful, but now our interfaces are intolerably bloated. <br><br>
Solution <br><br>
<li> Factor out like logic and delegate it to another object. See <a href="#CompositePattern">CompositePattern</a>. <li> Fake accessors and handle missing accessors gracefully. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?FakingAccessorsUsingAutoload">FakingAccessorsUsingAutoload</a>. <li> Create a generic, catch-all or broad-usage methods. Pass the request encoded as a string or object describing which action to take, along with its arguments. Allow the object to delegate as needed, or just handle whichever it happens to know how to. See <a href="#ClassAsTypeCode">ClassAsTypeCode</a>. <li> Give up and use <i>->can('foo')</i> before ever calling <i>->foo()</i> to make sure that <i>foo()</i> is a defined method for that given object. The contract laid down by this interface would mere be that many functions may or may not exist. Code that uses the object must be ware.  <br><br>
<a href="#StateVsClass">StateVsClass</a> tells us to allow objects to handle methods differently depending on their state, rather than demand that every possibily behavior be exhibited by a seperate object, an ultimately impossible proposition.  <br><br>

Controller logic creeps in to something that should be pure state. When sending a message, you shouldn't be explaining how to interpret the message. The point of a command object is to establish a common language. If you're using the same abstraction to separate code, you're asking too much of the abstraction. Make an extensible command language: turn your base Command Object into an Abstract Class, and use a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PublisherSubscriber">PublisherSubscriber</a> model to dispense the commands to listeners that may or may not know how to deal with various subtypes. Rather than putting logic in the Command Object directly, let it contain Visitor Objects that were for some reason previously selected to do operations on that Command Object. <br><br>

"Hardcodes are dirty" is an oft recited mantra. Unable to get rid of them, you hide them.  Everything must be hardcoded at a certain point. Having each hardcode exist only once, and in a logical place, is the only solution. For example, you need to know the users name in your program, its already hardcoded into the passwords file or users database. If you can query it from the operating system, you've avoiding duplicating it. Second best would be to put it in a file in their home directory or profile. Next worst would be to hardcode it at the top of the program. Unacceptable would be to have it hardcoded all over the program. <br><br>

Synopsis: An error condition resulted from an attempt to do something. You've  set a flag indicating that this isn't working. The user has corrected the  problem, but your program still refuses to work. <br><br>
Only when failure is very expensive and the error condition arises  automatically without user guidance should failure be cached. Caching failure  creates a situation where the user is unable to isolate the cause of the  failure: despite fixing everything he can think of, it still refuses to work!  When failure is cached, the system should give a clear indication of what must  be done to clear the flag so the system will try again, in addition to a  description of the cause of the error. <br><br>

An <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ExtremeProgramming">ExtremeProgramming</a>, refactoring, design patterned guide to eeking an object out of your program. <br><br>
Or, objects: the next step. <br><br>
Anyone who has worked in the Real World for long suspects that boss types exist to take the fun out of work. In the metaworld of programming, management <a href="#footnote31">[31]</a> <br><br>
Objects are mandated by boss types when: <br><br>
<ul><li> The design isn't to be trusted to the programmer
<li> The program isn't to depend on a specific implementation by any one programmer
<li> Management desires a high-level view of the structure of the product that they can understand
</ul><br><br>
It should be easy to see why objects conjure images of opression. <br><br>
Objects are created willingly by Perl programmers when: <br><br>
<ul><li> Returning a complex data structure from a module
<li> There is no procedural interface to a module
</ul><br><br>
Objects should not be created by Perl programmers when: <br><br>
<ul><li> Features are anticipated that would make an object useful
<li> Datastructures may have to expand in the future to hold more data
<li> This programmer is merely a designer, not involved in the actual programming
</ul><br><br>
Human intuition is amazing. No matter how neurotic it appears, there is always a motivating gem of truth burried below the surface. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TonyHoare">TonyHoare</a> is famous for saying, "premature optimization is the root of all evil". Another saying has come into fashion: "premature generalization is the root of all evil". <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ExtremeProgramming">ExtremeProgramming</a>  teaches us "don't code it; you won't need it". Being able to cleanly and quickly make changes to a program is far more important than having piled on dubious features in advance. Perlers, if anyone, should see the wisdom here. Adding more features, more interfaces, more facilities means more code and more complexity to try to adapt to what is really needed. Implementing prematurely sacrifices valuable opportunity to form insights into how to structure the code cleanly. If there is any doubt, don't add the feature - yet. <br><br>
Objects should be created by Perl programmers when: <br><br>
<ul><li> There is too much data in a data structure
<li> There are too many functions in a program
</ul><br><br>
I'm taking a hard line here by discounting 99% of the reasons cited for creating objects. There are volumes and volumes of formulistic texts describing how to design any sort of program, yet doing so effectively remains a black art. These formulas are endorced as being universally correct with the phrase "domain independent". In reality, no solutions are domain independent. I've yet to see one domain indepent solution capable of tieing shoes. <br><br>
Recently, a new fad became fashionable: Refactoring. The idea is simple and timeless: code cannot be written perfectly the first pass. Nor can the first version include support for every feature that might eventually be hacked on. The only solution is dedication to ongoing improvements, iteratively learning from past shortcomings, a willingness to break existing code. <br><br>
Many programmers have been disguested by a large, but working, program and have resolved to rewrite the whole mess <a href="#footnote32">[32]</a>. This results in burn out quicker than any other practise in programming. The reward of solving the problem and procuring a working program has already been had. The only thing remaining is minor bragging rights. Half way through the project, the real importance of these bragging rights are realized. Refactoring's most important contribution may well be techniques for migrating from sprawl to order. <br><br>

Actually, I think it's the approach that is taken to generalization. If you  design something and it isn't general so you add lots of hooks and conditionals  to make it general that isn't a very good approach. <br><br>
What does make generalization handy is the removal of special-case conditionals  and hooks. Sometimes it's difficult to come up with a true general solution,  and in that case you may have to live with specialized code. <br><br>
Of course, when you do have a general solution that does cover all cases (and  even potentially the ones you haven't though of) it usually ends up being quite  elegant and maintainable. <br><br>

Refactoring is a collection of techniques for making code... well, better.  Different techniques have different goals: flexibility, maintainability,  understandability, and so on. The single guiding light is simply to put things  where they belong. Putting things where they belong buys us loose coupling,  where objects aren't attached together so strongly that they might as well be  the same object. It buys us ... well. <br><br>
The phrase is borrowed from mathematics, as is so much in computer science. It  is known in mathematics by another name as well: "simplify". A simple case of simplifying being: <br><br>
<pre>
  x*5 + 10 = x*2 + 32

</pre>
Refactored: <br><br>
Factoring itself refers to breaking terms down into the parts which can be  multiplied together. In effect, we un-multiply them: <br><br>
<pre>
  15 = 5 * 3

</pre>
When programming, the simplest thing you can break things down into is a matter  of opinion. Or rather, it is a matter of opinion what programs are composed of.  Instructions? Expressions? Functions? Objects? Modules? Some languages represent  everything with an object (Smalltalk, for instance). This lets us abide by an  executive ruling that objects are the fundamental building block, which  pleasantly closes the question. Perl being pragmatic, programs are built in  strata. Packages are built on objects are built on functions are built on  expressions. Just like a polynomial expression, these combine in different ways  to create something more complex. <br><br>
What does re-evaluating how we've assembled our programs buy us? Simplicity, I guess. <br><br>

Initially, your object will be custom crafted to do the exact single thing that  it needs to. As maintainability enter the picture, you're faced with options of  breaking it down into parts, subclassing it to change things around, and  creating a common interface type between it and a new object. All of these  techniques should be used in combination, with generalization being the rule:  It should only be broken into parts if that aids in generalizing. When dividing  the objects, leave the simplest logic needed to implement the object in the  base class, and move your customizations to the subclass. If providing a  completely different implementation from the ground up, turn the old implementation  into an empty base class (interface), and move the old code into a class that  implements that interface, leaving open the chance to implement a plug-in replacement.  <br><br>

This is the simplest form of generalization, and the first a programmer learns. Not long after prodding the computer to add two numbers: <br><br>

You move on to write reusable pieces of code needed to build things just more complex than the simplest structures. <br><br>
<pre>
  sub indent {
    print '  ' x $_[0], $_[1], "\n";

Functions let you repeat a bit of logic without having to repeat it in the  program. This lets you repeat it an unknown number of times, and makes it easy  to run it or not run it under different variable conditions. <br><br>

Functions that grow in use also grow in size. After a certain point, it becomes  clear that functions can benefit from using functions themselves. Your eyes probe  the function looking for a likely candidate to relocate elsewhere. This candidate  is chosen for being the largest stretch of code that really has nothing to do  with the enclosing function. This lets us easily think up a name that explains  what the new function does without having to resort to something contrived just  to distinguish it from the original function. <br><br>

Tasks are tied to data: they change data, examine data, construct new data from data, answer questions about data, store data, output data, input data, and so on. <br><br>
I'd like to talk for a minute about how data gets around. As it turns out, tracking the movements of data is much more difficult than tracking the flow of code, and this difficulty shows up during almost any debugging effort. There are two primary ways that data gets around: <li> It is stashed somewhere, and by convention anyone who wants it knows where to look for it. <li> It is explicitly provided to any routine that needs data. <br><br>
About 25 years ago, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?StructuredProgramming">StructuredProgramming</a> set out to nail BASIC and similar languages into their coffins for two reasons: it was impossible to follow the flow of code, and it was impossible to follow the flow of data. The former method was used: data was referenced by name. That means that should you want to use one subroutine on a different variable than the one it was coded to use, you can't. You had to work around that. You were forced to store the current value of the variable into a new variable, change the variable it operators on, call it, save the result, then restore the original value. You had to dance the hookey-pookey just to get reuse a small bit of common logic. <br><br>
<pre>
  100 OLDA=A
  110 A=50
  120 GOSUB 200
  130 PRINT "The result is: ";PRINT $A
  140 A=OLDA
  ...
  200 A=B*100
  210 RETURN

</pre>
What seems like the simple solution, stashing data somewhere and giving it a name, turns out to be a nightmare. Subroutines couldn't safely be written that that would perform a given operation on any give piece of data. Later versions of BASIC of course changed this, but not until a few new generations of langauges came and whooped it one. <br><br>
Lets take another example. If you have a program that iterates over  files in a directory, performing some operation on each in turn, you may find  that you have a few subroutines and a main routine, not unlike this: <br><br>
<pre>
  opendir my $d, "arts/" or die $!;

  my $processedflag = 0;
  my $file;

  FILE: while($file = readdir($d)) {
    # attempt to process the file, set $processedflag if successful
    handle_delete();
  }

  sub handle_delete {
    unlink $file if $processedflag;
    $processedflag = 0;
  }

</pre>
Later on, we decide to add the ability to handle all of the subdirectories of  the given directory, a change of heart brought on by an interaction with an  individual who expects you to code things he can't even remember, much less  communicate. <br><br>
<pre>
  sub process_directory {
    my $dir = shift;

    opendir my $d, $dir or die $!;

    my $processedflag = 0;
    my $file;

    FILE: while(my $file = readdir($d)) {
      if(-d $file) {
        process_directory($file); 
      } else {
        # attempt to process the file, set $processedflag if successful
        # we now have to explicitly pass our arguments!
        handle_delete($file, $processedflag);
    }
  }

  sub handle_delete {
    my $file = shift;
    my $processedflag = shift;
    unlink $file if $processedflag;
    $processedflag = 0;
  }

  process_directory('arts/');

</pre>
If we hadn't changed the call to handle_delete() to pass arguments, and  modified the subroutine handle_delete to use local variables instead of global  variables, $processedflag could hold left over data, altered by a call made  from process_directory() to process_directory() that returned. It used to be  that each instance of a running programmer had one main loop that used these  variables. Now, this is a function that could be called several times, and  even have several copies running at the same time, as it calls itself. Data  that was specific to the program is now specific to an individual function  call. Our variable definitions reflect this change. <br><br>
There are many ways that data can get around; I've discussed only two so far: global variables and function arguments.  To whe your appetite, here are some more: <li> Passed to the constructor of an object <li> Contained in an object that was passed <li> Sent over the network, saved in a file, or passed through a threads::shared::queue <li> Bound to a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosure">LambdaClosure</a> <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="GlobalToLexical"><h2>GlobalToLexical</h2><br> <br><br>
Given a global variable that is only used in a few closely related functions, turn the variable into a lexical <i>my</i> variable, and define those functions lexically. <br><br>
<pre>
  # Before:

  use vars qw/$foo/;

  sub bar {
     do_something_with($foo);
  }

  sub baz {
    print $foo, "\n";
  }

  # After:

  do {

    my $foo;

    *bar = sub { 
      do_something_with($foo);
    };

    *baz = sub { 
      print $foo, "\n";
    };
    
  };

</pre>
The syntax changes on the function definitions. Thats annoying. This syntax is needed so that the functions are generated then and there, which ties them to their surrounding context - including the lexical variables - but in a fast, efficient way. Only <i>bar()</i> and <i>baz()</i> can see <i>$foo</i> now. You could say that they are the only things in <i>$foo</i>'s scope. The reduced scope makes the grouping visible, which makes the association obvious.  <br><br>
This construct can be nested: One block of code can contain another block, and so on. Multiple, nested scopes are acheived this way. In fact, we can do this inside of the subroutines we create as well, and keep propogating the context along. See <a href="#InnerClasses">InnerClasses</a> for one such example. <br><br>
Three gross cases for creating lexicals can emerge: <li> Inside <i>new()</i> <li> Inside <i>export()</i> <li> At the top level of the code <br><br>
With <i>new()</i>, it doesn't make sense to define functions inside of our own package: the second time someone creates an instance of us, we overwrite the previous definitions of those subroutines. You shouldn't have package global data in a module that lets people create instances of it using new, anyway. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AnonymousSubroutineObject">AnonymousSubroutineObject</a>. <br><br>
Co-opting <i>export()</i>, you have the perfect chance to export routines that are in the scope of the lexical <i>my</i> variables you've declared. See <a href="#ExportingPattern">ExportingPattern</a>. <br><br>
At the top level of the code is a fine and dandy place, and an incremental improvement for most modules. It doesn't get us the same multiplicity as the other two cases though. <br><br>
<i>640k should be plenty of memory for anyone.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?BillGates">BillGates</a> <br><br>
Former global (or local) variables converting to lexical buys us something very special: it opens the door to having multiple independent values exist at once. Deciding that only one of any given will ever be needed is frequently the fatal assumption that stops a growing program in its tracks. This is no different than saying that no one will ever have two computers at home, so networking isn't important, or there is no reason to virtualize resources because no one will ever want to run more than one program at once, or the computer need only support one video card because no one will ever attach two displays to one computer.

<br><br> <a name="SoftrefsToHash"><h2>SoftrefsToHash</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Computing variable names. Period. <br><br>
Solution: Use hashes or other datastructures. <br><br>
The power and the flexibility of having direct access to the symbol table is alluring. However, nearly anything that can be done using it can be done more cleanly using hashes, arrays, their references, and objects. Name table abuse breaks down as soon as things start to get complicated because of the requirement that everything have a unique name. This problem is called namespace collision. Using hashes has the advantage that each hash is seperate from the others. There are security considerations in this kind of seperation as well. <br><br>
<pre>
  # store things in the correct array - ugly

  print "Who should get a cookie? "; my $name = &lt;STDIN>;
  print "What kind of cookie should they get? "; my $cookie = &lt;STDIN>;

  push @{'cookies_for_'.$name}, $cookie;  

  # store things in the correct array - clean

  my $peoples_cookies = {};

  print "Who should get a cookie? "; my $name = &lt;STDIN>;
  print "What kind of cookie should they get? "; my $cookie = &lt;STDIN>;
  
  push @{$peoples_cookies->{$name}}, $cookie;

</pre>
The already confusing reference syntax becomes even more confusing when you want to refer to something other than a scalar: <br><br>
<pre>
  # scalars are easy:

  my $cookie = $peoples_cookies->{'fred'}->[0];

  # but refering to an array or hash inside of a data structure is confusing:

  my @cookies = @{$peoples_cookies->{'fred'}};

</pre>
The syntax for using datastructures is remarkably like the syntax for accessing the symbol table directly. The difference is what goes inside of the request to dereference: <br><br>
<pre>
  @{...something...}        # this is how you dereference something as an array
  %{...something...}        # this is how you dereference something as a hash

</pre>
A "soft reference" or "symbolic reference" is a reference used this way with an expression that contains the <u></u>name__ of the variable that contains the data.  <br><br>
A "hard reference" is a proper datastructure. The expression inside of the dereference actually contains a perl reference of the correct type. The backslash operator, \,  creates these references from regular <i>my</i> variables: <br><br>
<pre>
  open my $wordsfile, '/usr/share/dict/words' or die $!;
  my @words = &lt;$words>; 
  close $wordsfile;

  my $something = \@words;

  print "The words I know are: ", @{$something}, "\n";

</pre>
The "my" in this example is important - otherwise our variable will be overwritten if we do this in a loop, and if we exit out of a block, it may vanish entirely. <br><br>
In both cases, soft references and hardreferences, there is one big pitfall: Perl automatically creates things as you refer to them. It is hard to casually tell if you're using the wrong syntax, as Perl considers them both valid. <br><br>
<pre>
  $peoples_cookies->{'fred'}->[0] = 'sugar cookie';
  print *{'cookies_for_fred'}, "\n";                    # theres nothing there, and no warning

</pre>
Perl will stop you if you use "soft" references (directly access the symbol table) while <i>use strict</i> is on. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="TooManyArguments"><h2>TooManyArguments</h2><br> <br><br>
Having multiple implementations of the primary function is counter-intuitive.  We consider the function to be a failure if it can't handle all cases. We grow  the original function, and move more and more code to satellite functions, and  the original function grows in scope. As it grows, it gains arguments. The  arguments may signal which behaviors we want, and may give data specific to different behaviors. <br><br>
Typically a function that takes a lot of arguments will tend to be called with  most of the arguments the same each time, as we tend to reuse certain behaviors.  You could create several wrapper functions, each of which hardcodes a value,  but this only has monomic value and doesn't scale. A better solution is to  create a small wrapper for the function or method when we need it, that remembers some of the arguments. <br><br>
<pre>
  my $a = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MapDaemon">MapDaemon</a>($mapob);
  my $i = shift();
  $a->send_region($i, 10, 15, $x2, $y2);

</pre>
...would become... <br><br>
<pre>
  my $a = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MapDaemon">MapDaemon</a>($mapob);
  my $i = shift();
  my $send_region = sub { $a->send_region($i, 10, 15, shift(), shift()); };
  $send_region->($x2, $y2);

</pre>
In this example, $i and $a are lexically bound to the variables of the same  name created just before it. If you change the value of these variables, it  affects the code reference you've created in $send_region. If you pass $send_region  off, or if you return it, $i and $a will continue to hold their values. 10 and 15  will be hardcoded in and cannot be changed. The two argument positions that contain  the keyword shift() will take their arguments from what is passed to the reference  that is created. This illustrates three different ways of getting values into  the code reference. Each has its purpose and its place.  <br><br>
<pre>
  my $a = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MapDaemon">MapDaemon</a>($mapob);
  my $i = shift();
  my $send_region_x = sub { $a->send_region($i, $x1, $y, $x2, $y); };
  my $send_region_y = sub { $a->send_region($i, shift(), $y, shift(), $y); };
  foreach $x1 (1..100) {
    foreach $x2 (1..100) {
      $send_region->();
      # $send_region->($x1, $x2) would do exactly the same thing
    }
  }

</pre>
The advantage of the approach that uses $send_region->() is that we could set  values for $x1 and $x2, and pass $send_region out to another routine that could  supply more arguments, without actually having to explicitly pass $x1 and $x2 along with $send_region.  <br><br>
Creating custom, special purpose code references that have some of their arguments  already filled, or have some of their arguments attached to lexically defined data, is called "currying".   <br><br>
Objects can, and often should, do something similar to currying. Avoid temptation to <a href="#AccumulateAndFire">AccumulateAndFire</a> - don't set a bunch of values using accessors then call a method that implicitly depends on that data. That amounts to global variables, and ther interdependencies become difficult to track. Do use <a href="#FactoryObject">FactoryObject</a>, <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a>, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InnerClass">InnerClass</a>, and <a href="#ImmutableObject">ImmutableObject</a>. <br><br>
<li> <a href="#FactoryObject">FactoryObject</a>, <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a>: Methods can return a custom-crafted object, configured from your arguments to the factory method. The resulting object can be tickled and poked and prodded, while we rest secure in the knowledge that the processes whereby that object obtained its state is crystal clear. The methods we call still work on essentially global data, but this global data is the very essense of the object, not merely some globalized parameter data. <li> <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InnerClass">InnerClass</a>: A special case of a <a href="#FactoryObject">FactoryObject</a>. The only significant difference  is that the returned object is defined inline, right in middle of the "factory"  code that creates it. Objects with global state should have global state  only specific to that object. This makes for very small objects. Defining very small objects right in middle of the function that creates them is really the way to go. <li> <a href="#ImmutableObject">ImmutableObject</a>: Every change to the object yeilds a new, updated copy. It won't sweep excessive amounts of object-global data under the rug, but it'll reaffirm the object as being the unique combination of its state. Most importantly, we don't have to worry about another section of code having a reference to the object and mucking up its state when we aren't looking: every change creates a new, unique copy all our own. <br><br>

Information changes according to events. Events dictate that the internal  representation of the world be brought up to date with the state of the real  world. You store representations in lists, hashes, lists of lists, hashes of  lists, and so on. As the datastructures become more complex, you spend more and  more time trying to remember which order you have to dereference your references  in. Then you have to remember what order fields are stored in an array. <br><br>
Trying to remember how to get from point A to point B across a network of references is error prone and tedious. <br><br>
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl

  my $con = connect_to_server(@ARGV);

  my @treasure;
  my $x;
  my $y;
  my $bot;
  my @bots;

  # ...

  sub process_treasure {
    # build a list of treasure
    my $line = $con->('read');
    while($line =~ m/\G(\d+) (\d+) (\d+) (\d+) ?/g) {
      # read from server: id destx desty weight ..., eg: 17 133 28 50 89 11 57 78
      # add fields for the $x, $y location of the treasure and the (optional) object that holds it, if any
      push @treasure, [$x, $y, undef, $4, $2, $3, $1];
    }
  }

  sub available_treasure {
    # return a list of treasure at our location
    my @result;
    foreach my $treasure (@treasure) {
      # huh?
      push @result, $treasure if $treasure->[0] == $x and $treasure->[1] == $y and !$treasure->[2];
    }
    return @result;
  }

</pre>
Lets fancy for a moment that we have a whole bunch of code that looks like this.  We don't want to have to keep looking up which fields represent what, but we  don't have time right now to change all of the code for the privilege of using  symbolic names. In fact, if we had to change the existing code in order to get  symbol names for the fields, we wouldn't bother. It would be more work than  continuing on this path. If we did convert it, our first intuition would be to  turn the arrays into hashes. Here is another approach: <br><br>
<pre>
  # in Treasure.pm:

  package Treasure;

  sub new { my $type = shift; bless [@_ || (0)x7], $type; }
  sub x :lvalue { $_[0]->[0] }
  sub y :lvalue { $_[0]->[1] }
  sub bot :lvalue { $_[0]->[2] }
  sub weight :lvalue { $_[0]->[3] }
  sub destx :lvalue { $_[0]->[4] }
  sub desty :lvalue { $_[0]->[5] }
  sub id :lvalue { $_[0]->[6] }

  1;

  package <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Treasure/">Treasure</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Treasure::Chest">Chest</a>;

  sub new { bless $_[1] || [], $_[0]; }
  sub get { my $t = $_[0]->[$_[1]] ||= new Treasure; bless $t, 'Treasure'; $t->id() = $_[1]; $t; }
  sub all_treasure { my $self = shift; map { $self->[$_] ? $self->get($_) : undef } (0..scalar(@$self)-1); }

  1;

  # back in our main program:

  use Treasure; 
  my $treasurechest = new <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Treasure/">Treasure</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Treasure::Chest">Chest</a>(\@treasure); 

  # lets see available_treasure() again, rewritten to use the named fields:

  sub available_treasure {
    # return a list of treasure at our location
    my @result;
    foreach my $treasure ($treasurechest->all_treasure()) {
      push @result, $treasure if $treasure->x == $x and $treasure->y == $y and !$treasure->bot;
    }
    return @result;
  }

  sub take_treasure {
    my $treasureid = shift;
    my $treasure = $treasurechest->get($treasureid);
    # associate the treasure with our bot:
    $treasure->bot = $bot;
    # add the treasures weight to our weight:
    $bot->[3] += $treasure->weight;
  }

</pre>
With just a few short lines of code, we've written an object oriented wrapper  for our data structure that doesn't get in the way of using our data structure  normally. The old functions continue to work, and we can write new functions in  the new style, or the old style, or a mixture of styles. Of course, when we have  time, we may want to go clean up the old code. Perhaps we've been meaning to  rewrite it all anyway. Who has ever heard of object oriented programming where  introducing a new object type doesn't require changes to all of your data reference?  <br><br>
How does this all work? We create our <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Treasure/">Treasure</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Treasure::Chest">Chest</a> using a reference to the  @treasure array. The array of treasure records becomes synonymous with the  treasure chest. This is done in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Treasure/">Treasure</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Treasure::Chest">Chest</a>'s new() routine. The records  in the array become synonymous with individual treasure instances. This is done  in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Treasure/">Treasure</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Treasure::Chest">Chest</a>'s get() routine. As we get() objects, they are blessed into  the Treasure package. When using the OO accessor style, we need to go through  the treasure chest container to get the objects, instead of using the @treasure  array directly. Existing code can continue using the @treasure array without  knowledge of our trickery. We could have created proper accessors, but our  immediate goal was to attach names to the array fields. To achieve this, we  created subroutines that returned the correct field of the array. We mark them  :lvalue so that we can assign a value back into them. Perl makes the parenthesis  optional on method calls, so we can write code that looks like we're assigning  to a C structure field or Java public instance variable. We use this to assign  to $treasure, when we say $treasure->bot = $bot in take_treasure(). Perl understands this expression to mean: <br><br>
<pre>
  $treasure->bot() = $bot;

</pre>
...which looks highly unnatural. We were assigning to a function before, but it  didn't look like it because the function call didn't have parenthesis on the end.  How can you possibly assign to a function? :lvalue functions never return a string  constant or the result of an arithmetic expression. They do give as their  result a variable, or an expression that references a primitive variable. It is  this variable that is assigned to. The lvalue function can pick which variable  is assigned to, or even let the user assign to the result of another function  if that function is also lvalue. substr(), for instance, is lvalue. That means  both of these are legal: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub foo :lvalue { $_[0] ? $a : $b }
  foo(0) = 10; # assign 10 to $a
  foo(1) = 30; # assign 30 to $b

  sub bar :lvalue { substr($a, 10, 5) }
  bar() = "xyzzy";

</pre>
Note that we don't use return. Return makes a copy, and that would damage out  intentions. In other words, return() isn't lvalue. What is assigned to is the last expression in the block. <br><br>
Returning to our wrapper class and container class, this approach works for  hashes as well, though there is less of a need to name hash fields. Less, but  not none. Creating an object wrapper catches cases where we typo the hash subscript: <br><br>
<pre>
  $treasure->{'wegiht'} = 30; # this would go unnoticed by the compiler
  $treasure->wegiht = 30; # this would be caught the first time it ran

</pre>
Catching the error right away helps us quickly track down the problem. Using a  hash index, we might be confounded why the weight wasn't updating correctly, and  search all over the program, not knowing which part of the code that accesses it  to suspect. Some typos are hard to notice, especially after you've been staring  at code all day. I've spent hours trying to find a logic error only to discover  a subtle typo. Its annoying. Another advantage of using the OO accessor approach  is that we can do value checking, to make sure the new value itself isn't bogus  or empty. We can also trigger side effects, and update other global state of the  object, or notify observer objects of the state change, or countless other behaviors. <br><br>
Put things together that change together.  <br><br>
You'll frequently face the decision of which data items to lump together into  an object. One rule is, if their values are interdependent, then the code that  enforces the relationship should have easy access to all of the values. In other  words, if the values change together, put them together. If you wanted to be a  purist, you could barrow from relational database design: XXX all data fields  should describe the primary item, generally an ID. Databases need to be purist,  though: if you need to change the data representation of your program, you can  kill it, make the change, and start it up again. Databases afford no such luxury:  changing the structure of the data would require changes to many other tables,  reordering potentially large amounts of information on disc, and requiring all  applications that use the database to be modified to reflect the change. With  databases, it pays to be overly cautious about breaking up data into atomic  collections. With applications, you can usually put it off until the need arises. <br><br>

When accessing the treasure object, you'll notice that certain snippits of code are being repeated over and over. There are two cases with the treasure object: <br><br>
<ul><li> A robot, possibly ours, has it and is carrying it around, and the location of the treasure is really the location of the robot holding it.
<li> The treasure object is on the ground, and its location is correct.
</ul><br><br>
Given that, you'll see this test over and over: <br><br>
<pre>
  if($treasure->bot) {
    $x = $treasure->bot->x;
    $y = $treasure->bot->y;
  } else {
    $x = $treasure->x;
    $y = $treasure->y;
  }

</pre>
This is error prone, and tedious. It doesn't fit at all with our laziness. If  we change the definition of the x() and y() methods in Treasure.pm, we can  write this <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?OnceAndOnlyOnce">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub x :lvalue { $_[0]->bot ? $_[0]->bot->x : $_[0]->[0]; }
  sub y :lvalue { $_[1]->bot ? $_[0]->bot->y : $_[0]->[1]; }

</pre>
In the future, asking for <i>$treasure->x</i> or <i>$treasure->y</i> gives the correct, expected value.  Since <i>:lvalue</i> methods behave just like variables, we can do things like this: <br><br>
<pre>
  $treasure->y-- if $dir eq 'north';
  $treasure->y++ if $dir eq 'south';
  $treasure->x++ if $dir eq 'east';
  $treasure->x-- if $dir eq 'west';

</pre>
Even though <i>x()</i> and <i>y()</i> are methods, the <i>++</i>, <i>--</i>, and all other operators work on them as if they were a variable. Perl actually performs those operations on the last variable mentioned in the expression, before the method returns. An <i>:lvalue</i> function can itself be the last thing mentioned in an <i>:lvalue</i> function: these rules are recursive. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AccessorsPattern">AccessorsPattern</a> for more examples of this technique. <br><br>
If you later write a function to compute the polar coordinates of the treasure  (a distance and radius from a point), the natural place to put it would be in  the Treasure object, where the data is immediately available. If the only time  people are going to be using that routine is with the treasure object, having  it associated with the treasure object itself makes it immediately available:  it comes with the data! Having functions associated with data does something  else, too: at least some of the arguments to the function are implied. If we  only used cartesian_to_polar() on treasure objects, it would be tedious to write: <br><br>
<pre>
  ($angle, $distance) = <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Converter/">Converter</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Converter::cartesian_to_polar">cartesian_to_polar</a>($treasure->x, $treasure->y);

</pre>
... if instead we could write: <br><br>
<pre>
  ($angle, $distance) = $treasure->to_polar();

</pre>
The arguments are built in to the function! <br><br>
The real beauty of object methods isn't implicitly operating on the objects  data, or giving names to array indices. Objects represent collections of data  that change together. Since people are calling methods rather than changing the  data directly, we control how the data changes. We can put a serious dent in a  whole class of logic errors where data is handled inconsistently. Done correctly,  we can prevent one rogue, erroroneus part of the program from doing damage that  causing other, distant parts of the program from failing later. We can put the  object state change logic all inside the object and keep it in one place. We can  save other code from having to replicate that logic all over the program. We can  set requirements for accessing the data that fail immediately, rather than some  time later, pin pointing bad code. <br><br>
The way we have our accessor now, we're just handing out access to the data.  The problem is, since the treasure could be either on the floor or in the clutches  of our robot, some other lesser programmer working on the project might forget  to check if the treasure is being carried before setting its location. This  would change the location of the robot and all of the other packages it holds!  When the robot started teleporting all over the place, we'd have no idea where  to look for the bad code. It could be anywhere. When this happens, its time to  tighten the reigns and institute some access control: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub set_x {
    if($_[0]->bot) {
      die "Cretin! I've TOLD you to check ->bot() before trying to set the location! It is illegal to set the location on an object thats being carried!";
    }
    # "x" is the first array position
    $_[0]->[0] = $_[1];
  }

  sub query_x {
    return  $_[0]->bot ? $_[0]->bot->x : $_[0]->[0];
  }

</pre>
<i>query_x()</i> is almost exactly like our old <i>x()</i>, except it isn't an <i>:lvalue</i> function.  To change our X location, someone needs to first check <i>bot()</i>, and if there  isn't a value there, then set it using <i>set_x()</i>. This is our procedure and we're enforcing it. A rogue programmer could always meddle around inside of our  datastructure and ignore the OO interface, but we can only assume he knows what he is doing if he does that. There is a technique for hiding your data using  lexically scoped variables that prevents this trick from working: see  <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LexicalsMakeSense">LexicalsMakeSense</a> for some examples. Even that  isn't secure: using <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PadWalker">PadWalker</a> module, people can investigate and alter lexicals that  would otherwise be hidden from them. If you truly want to enforce a strict  policy for using your code from untrusted code, use the Safe module. This  locks them into a sandbox and lets you define what they can do there. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="SuperClassAbstraction"><h2>SuperClassAbstraction</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Competition between classes over a role leads to ambigious boundaries and confusing roles. <br><br>
Solution:  Given two similar classes, create a super-class, and move common code there.  Rename methods as needed in the subclasses to present a consistent interface. Use the new subclasses in place of the original classes. <br><br>
Dissimilarities should be noted with the presence or abscence of various <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MarkerInterface">MarkerInterface</a> - a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MarkerInterface">MarkerInterface</a> is a kind of <a href="#AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a>. <br><br>
When designing an interface, keep in mind: <br><br>
<li> The base object is the general case. Subclasses can and should create exceptions: subclasses are specific cases. Do-nothing methods and methods that operate depending on some condition or internal state are fair play. Don't confuse state with class: <a href="#StateVsClass">StateVsClass</a>. <li> Features may be added directly to the base parent class in the future to introduce new features to all subclasses.  <li> Subclasses of the new base class may have different personalities. Some may be useful for things that others aren't. Create a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MarkerInterface">MarkerInterface</a> and brand individual subclasses to mark them as approprate for  operations specific to their personalities. <a href="#footnote33">[33]</a> <li> Few is usually better than more. Should new functionality be needed in the future, it can be defined by an additional interface. Not all of the subclasses need implement it - only the ones for which it makes sense. This avoids having to rewrite all of the subclasses every time a new feature is introduced, and it prevents bloat. <li> The few operations should combine well. This means creating and returning  objects that can be directly used by other accessors and other objects. <br><br>
Looking at successful real-world designs, the first version provided  detailed access to every nook and cranny, but did little in the way of helping one use the object. Later versions augment the generic methods with convinience methods. XXX - examples of these so-called real-world designs. <br><br>

Root classes should be abstract.  When the class is handled, it should be referenced by the abstract type.  Doing otherwise defeats the primary purpose of using objects - polymorphism. Polymorphism is your ticket to painlessly expanding your application in the future. In a well designed program, adding features amounts to adding classes. You can't easily add a class if the name of one perticular implementation is hardcoded everywhere a class of that type is used. Instead, hardcode the generic type name in, and use one implementation of that type, keeping the door open for more implementations. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="LooseCoupling"><h2>LooseCoupling</h2><br> <br><br>
Concept: Loose Coupling <br><br>
Too much interdependency between objects defeats the purpose of using objects: <br><br>
<li> Names of objects are hardcoded. <li> Types are hardcoded that aren't abstract interface types. <li> Most of the objects know about most of the other objects. <br><br>
Loose Coupling makes it easier to replace one part of the program without breaking the entire program. The fewer changes that need to be made to accomodate replacing or removing an object, the better. <br><br>
<li> References to objects you depend on, or a reference to an object that can find them for you, are passed up by your constructor. See <a href="#PassingPattern">PassingPattern</a>. <li> Speak of objects in terms of abstract types rather than concrete types. Your code becomes tied to a general facility rather than one specific implementation of it. See <a href="#AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a>. Use <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a> to create objects of abstract type. <li> Rather than mucking with an object directly, you deal with an interface to a part of the program. This Facade is free to be implemented in a single object or thousands. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DelegationConcept">DelegationConcept</a>, <a href="#FacadePattern">FacadePattern</a>. <br><br>
Buildings that are overly tied to one perticular use tend to be the first demolished. Changing them is expensive, difficult, and potentially dangerous. Buildings which lend themselves to adaptation have continued value, and this is acheived through a firm but non-imposing structure clearly seperated from perticulars of the decor. Each support holds its own weight while short lived adaptations of the building support none. Each thing depends on things around it as little as possible. Opening a wall shouldn't bring the structure down. <br><br>

This is the play() method from our <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>.pm example. We mentioned this briefly in <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOrientationOrientation">ObjectOrientationOrientation</a>, but it bears lassification <a href="#footnote34">[34]</a>. Each object passed in is tested to see if they fit that type.  For <i>->isa()</i>, either being blessed into that package directly, or inheriting from that package will work. In the case of references, check the reference type directly:  <br><br>
<pre>
    my $arrayref = shift; ref $arrayref eq 'ARRAY' or die;

</pre>
Given a bless object, <i>ref()</i> will return its blessed type, but this usual isn't what we want: see <a href="#CheckingTypeInsteadOfMembership">CheckingTypeInsteadOfMembership</a>.

<br><br> <a name="DesignContract"><h2>DesignContract</h2><br> <br><br>
Polymorphism, the ability to use similar objects interchangably, rests on like objects providing same interfaces. <br><br>
Intentionally deciding what the method names will be, and how they will work, for a given type of object, is called a "design contract". Creating an <a href="#AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a> specifies such a design contract. Implementing the interface specified by an <a href="#AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a> realizes this contract. <br><br>
"Design by contract" means to design a system in terms of APIs. The theory goes: if other objects can count on the API working as described, then the entire program will function correct as long as ConcreteClass<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ConcreteClass">+</a> implementations of that API are correct. Whether or not an implementation is correct can easily be tested in isolation using <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UnitTests">UnitTests</a>. If the APIs are implemented correctly, the contract is met, and the program works. Or, thats the theory. For this to work, the definitions of how the APIs handle  CornerCases<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?CornerCases">+</a> must be unambigious, and programmers must not interpret them incorrectly, or make StupidMistakes<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?StupidMistakes">+</a>. Nothing can save a program from StupidMistakes<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?StupidMistakes">+</a>. The contract, or API specification, creates a focal point point for testing and bickering over specifications, limiting the scope of places where that perticular kind of lack of definition can impact the program. <br><br>
Design by contract usually imples that the language compiler or interpreter is enforcing the contract to the degree that the contract specifies object types and method names.  JavaLanguage<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?JavaLanguage">+</a> goes as far as to validate that programmers are handling error conditions that methods list as potential reasons for failure. Most <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> languages, including Java, have a concept of "visibility": private visibility, public visibility, and various shades inbetween are enforced at compile time, preventing even the mere mention of something that you shouldn't have access to. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="LayeringPattern"><h2>LayeringPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: You broke your code up into different packages, where it logically  belongs. However, some new features were added, and you have to start using  variables for the packages to refer to each other by because it is no longer  true that they already know which other module to invoke. Or, some parts of the  code change frequently, so you've made it easy to swap the violate bits in and  out, distancing the flurry with an API, and placed it on an outer-more layer. <br><br>
When: The layout seemed clear, but now it isn't so straight-forward. You're  afraid that even if you change it again, it wont be good enough, and you'll  have to come back later and change it all around as soon as another feature is  added. <br><br>
Symptoms: One class has the name of another class hard-coded into it, and it  isn't using this hard-code to do argument type checking or to inherit. <br><br>
If you draw your object layout on a piece of paper, it is easy to start thinking  of the design as "flat". A good design is anything but flat. Which objects i nherit from and implement which others can be expressed accurately on a page  of paper. Which objects hold pointers to which other kinds of objects is another  page, with arrows going all over the place. When you consider both of these  kinds of relationships together, you get something much more involved. To  simplify it as much as possible, keep your objects general, so that they work  on types of objects, not specific objects, and certainly not just packages  whose names they have hard-coded into them. Rather than thinking of objects  holding references to other objects as random arrows flying around a page,  consider the references an object holds to be very private things, to be protected  and cherished. Generally speaking, if you have a "has a" relationship with an  object, you will seldom want to pass out references to it, or share references  to it with more than one other object. Instead, you will want to use your own  interface, or another well understood interface, to present your treasured  object to the world. Simply put, consider your object to contain objects that  you hold references to, and communicate with the highest level holding an object  as possible, rather than going over their heads. <br><br>
This gives layers to go through to reach an object. The layers present a chance  to insert needed patterns, such as Adapters, Facades, Mementos, and Aggregate  Containers. Bypassing this encapsulation robs designers of the chance to organize  the layout. Being able to introduce other machinery lets the program grow.  Keeping things at arms length lets you isolate other objects from violate code  and parts of the system that are prone to changing.  <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="FunctionalProgramming"><h2>FunctionalProgramming</h2><br> <br><br>
<i>There is sometimes a game played with ALGOL 60 programs - rewriting them to</i> <i>avoid using</i> goto <i>statements. It is part of a more embracing game - reducing the</i> <i>extent to which the program conveys its information by explicit sequencing ... The</i> <i>games significance is that it frequently produces a more "transparent" program - </i> <i>easier to understand, debug, modify, and incorporate into a larger program.</i> -- Peter Landin, at the ACM Programming Language and Pragmatics Conference, care of Knuth's Literate Programming <br><br>
What is a program if not explicit sequencing? Webster's 1913 Unabridged dictionary says: <br><br>
<i>Programme \Pro"gramme\, n. <a href="#footnote35">[35]</a> That which is written or printed as a public notice or advertisement; a scheme; a prospectus; especially, a brief outline or explanation of the order to be pursued, or the subjects embraced, in any public exercise, performance, or entertainment; a preliminary sketch.</i>   <pre>
  
</pre>
"...a brief outline or explanation of the order to be pursued...". The strong analogy between the sequences of instructions given to computers and the planned ordering of events in a musical or theatrical performance lead early British coders to coin the phrase.  <br><br>
Think of FORTRAN. Mathematicians, interested in using computers to compute results of formulas, manually translated the functions into lines of FORTRAN. FORTRAN itself stands for "Formula Translator". Expressions of one kind - formulas - had to be manually translated into a simple, sequential steps that early computers could understand. <br><br>
<a href="#FunctionalProgramming">FunctionalProgramming</a> purports to do away with explicit sequencing of steps in favor the more implicit function computation. By naming the task to be done, and defining  the task, the language fosters a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TopDownProgramming">TopDownProgramming</a> approach to designing and writing programs. The assignment operation has been singled out for removal from functional languages. This dramatically alters the concept of "global state". Just about everything about the state of a running program can be summerized by where you are in the execution of the code. This is very algorithm-centric, as opposed to data-centric. <br><br>
<pre>
  # Haskell qsort:
  
  qsort []     = []
  qsort (x:xs) = qsort elts_lt_x ++ [x] ++ qsort elts_greq_x
                 where
                   elts_lt_x   = [y | y &lt;- xs, y &lt; x]
                   elts_greq_x = [y | y &lt;- xs, y >= x]
  
  # perl qsort:
  
  sub qsort {
    !@_ ? () : (qsort(grep { $_ &lt; $_[0] } @_[1..$#_]),
               $_[0],
               qsort(grep { $_ >= $_[0] } @_[1..$#_]));
  }
  
  print "output: ", join ' ', qsort(51,382,5,28,382,28,6,3,92,8), "\n";
  
  
</pre>
The Haskell can reportedly be read as: define the result of qsort'ing the empty set as the empty set itself.  qsort'ing one or more elements puts the first element in x and the rest in xs. qsort is defined recursively. Each pass, it divides up the work. When it has been broken down as far as it can be, all of the parts are reassembled, in order. The basis for breaking it down at each stage is dividing xs into things less than x and things greater than or equal to x. Each of these subsets are themselves run through qsort, with x itself stuck in the middle. <br><br>
There are a few assignments. They aren't imparitive instructions, but rather a general definition of a method for computing values. It could be read as a function definition, in fact. "In general, elts_lt_x is the set of things from xs such that each is less than x". <br><br>
The Perl version is intentionally similar. If passed no argument, the null set is returned: <br><br>
<pre>
  !@_ ? () : ...

</pre>
This is a matter of explicit test placed before the recursive calls. I said it was similar, not identical. The Haskell version shuns anything explicitly sequential. We don't built any local definitions for elts_lt_x or elts_greq_x, though we could, using anonymous subroutines. Instead, we just use a couple of grep calls inline to filter our argument list, first for everything less than the first argument, then everything greater than or equal to the first argument. The first argument, $_[0], is sandwiched in the middle. @_[1..$#_] is an array slice. It returns a new array created from @_ with specified elements. Here, we're listing elements 1 through the number of elements in the array. $#_ contains the number of elements in @_, and the .. operator returns all of the integers between 1 and that. This just lets us skip the first element, since we're explicitly using it as a middle value and sandwiching it in the middle.  <br><br>
Using local subroutines, avoiding declaring variables, and depending heavily on the lexical nature of <i>my</i> variables, you can write a very nice emulation of functional code in Perl. Now the only question is, do we want to? <br><br>
Large numbers of global variables, or even instance variables in objects, creates a state explosion problem: there is an absolutely huge number of possible states  <a href="#footnote36">[36]</a> our program could be in at any given. Merely knowing where it is currently executing in the code tells us very little about where it is going to go. The code conditionally changes flow dependent on the state. This causes problems for a number of reasons. Since there is such a huge number of  possibilities - billions and billions for a program with a few integers - it is impossible to test every combinations of values. The global state of the program may become corrupt over time. One object may be locked or destroyed while another part of the code is still using it, for instance. <br><br>
The root cause is a kind of duality: code is expected to run as it is  encountered by the processor. This is the "here and now" of it. The data of the program is minipulated by these instructions. The data in the variables dictates what the program will do in the future. Self modifying code - programs that change their own instructions - are another example of current execution dictating what will happen in the future. Altering code pointers (routinely and invisibly done in both OO and lambda code) represent a very real sort of self modification: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub get_save_filter {
    my $ext = shift;
    my $stream = shift;
    return sub {
      # do something with $stream here
    } if $ext eq 'gif';
    return sub {
      # do something with $stream here for pngs
    } if $ext eq 'png';
    return sub {
      # do something with $stream here for jpgs
    } if $ext eq 'jpg';
  }

  print "Enter a filename to save the image:\n";
  my $filename = &lt;STDIN>;
  
  # find file extention: png, jpg, gif, etc
  (my $ext) = $filename =~ m/\.([a-z]+)/;
  my $save_filter = get_save_filter($ext);

  open my $f, '>', $filename;
  print $f $save_filter->($image_data);

</pre>
In this example, we're using data to pick a code pointer. $save_filter->() executes whatevercode $save_filter refers to. Both calling a polymorphic object method, and using Perl's eval on a string, also have the same effect. The code that gets executed may not find all of the data it wants in a suitable state, and we may not have realized the possibility of the sequence of events that  could lead to the situation.  <br><br>
As another example, compare: <br><br>
<pre>
  $dispatch_table->{$request}->();

...and... <br><br>

  GOTO REQUEST*1000

</pre>
In both cases, two things are clear. How we arrive at the actual code we're shooting for depends on only one variable, not every variable involved in the computation, and it isn't clear which variables will be used, and what their acceptable ranges are, once we arrive. Our data dictates the direction of the program, but our data and our program keep each other at quite a distance. <br><br>
Objects help a bit, as our global and instance data isn't immediately visible to whomever we're calling, and we're forced to explicitly pass it. This helps ensure that code doesn't wind up depending on data we weren't counting on it using. See <a href="#PassingPattern">PassingPattern</a> for some rote on bunding up state and passing that explicitly. In fact, the only thing missing is being forced to use general algorithms rather than explicit flow control change to define functionality. You're on your own there, partner. <br><br>
The hullmark of <a href="#FunctionalProgramming">FunctionalProgramming</a> is generic algorithms that aren't conditional or explicitly looped, but rather have their termination condition built in to the algorithm itself.  <br><br>
<pre>
  # procedural

  for(my $i=0; $i&lt;scalar @arr; $i++) {
    ...do something to $arr[$i]...
  }

  # functional

  @arr = map { ...do something to $_... } @arr; 

</pre>
<i>map()</i> has it's own termination condition built in: when there are no more array elements to process. <i>map()</i> also returns the output data as a list, avoiding the need for temporary storage - avoiding temporary storage avoids explicit sequencing of steps. Avoiding explicit sequencing of code avoids corner cases, and more imporatantly, avoids invloving the state of the program in the flow of the program - a sin I equated to the computed goto. <br><br>
Out of a useful tradition, <a href="#FunctionalProgramming">FunctionalProgramming</a> typically uses <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LazyEvaluation">LazyEvaluation</a> to cope with infinite lists. <br><br>
<pre>
  @arr = grep { $_ % 3 == 0 } (1..10000000); # out of memory
  foreach my $i (@arr) {
    do_something($arr[$i]);
  }

  # ... would be implemented internally using <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LazyEvaluation">LazyEvaluation</a> something like...

  my @arr;
  my $gen;
  do {
    my $counter;
    $gen = sub { $counter++; };
  };
  while(my $i = $gen->()) { do_something($i); }
  
</pre>
Code wouldn't be written this way, but this demonstrates what goes on internally. Perl does implement <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LazyEvaluation">LazyEvaluation</a> in a few places, including the <i>(1..1000)</i> construct. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LazyEvaluation">LazyEvaluation</a> makes dealing with "infinite lists" possible. <pre>

  $x = all { odd(shift) } [1, 1, 3]; # 1

  # Returns true is x is present in xs. You probably should not do this with 
  # infinite lists. Note that this assumes x and xs are numbers.

Even though both $c1 and $c2 are instances of the "Color" object, they have  different values. We call these variables "instance variables" because the  variable is associated with a specific instance of the class. <br><br>

Synopsis: Typing $me->{'foo'} to get to your "foo" instance variable is verbose and unnatural. Factor out the extra syntax for accessing instance  variables over static variables. <br><br>
When: Whenever you use instance variables in your classes, which should be often. <br><br>
Other <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> languages don't distinguish between instance variables and global variables in syntax, only definition. Perl does. This translates to more typing. <br><br>
<pre>
  # java:

  public void mouseDown(Event e, int x, int y) {
    lastx = x; lasty = y;
    return true;
  }

  # perl:

  sub mouseDown {
    my($this, $event, $x, $y) = @_;
    $this->{'lastx'} = $x;
    $this->{'lasty'} = $y;
    return 1;
  }

</pre>
<i>$this->{'lastx'}</i> is hardly a worthy substitute for being able to merely say  <i>$lastx</i> and have the language remember the fact that <i>$lastx</i> is an instance variable. This requirement is going a long way towards making our little program ugly. For longer functions, we can make some symbol table aliases to allow us to access things inside of a hash or array using a short name: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub mouseDown {

    my($this, $event, $x, $y) = @_;

    local *lastx = \$this->{'lastx'};
    local *lasty = \$this->{'lasty'};

    # now we can refer to $this->{'lastx'} merely as $lastx, just like Java and C++!

    $lastx = $x;
    $lasty = $y;

  }

</pre>
This just makes the problem worse for shorter functions, cluttering them with unneeded syntax. As a compromise, you can use this trick for large functions where instance variables are referenced over and over again, and for short functions, use the plain old hash dereference syntax that you already know and tolerate. Don't like those options? Me either. Lets see what else we can dig up: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Yawn;

  sub public { 
    local $this = shift;
    my $coderef = pop;
    my @fields = keys %$this;
    my $field;
    FIELD:
      $field = pop @fields;
      local *{$field};
      *{$field} = \$this->{$field};
    goto FIELD if(@fields);
    $coderef->(@_);
  }

  sub private {
    caller(1) eq <u></u>PACKAGE__ or 
      die sprintf "Cannot invoke private method %s from outside %s", 
        (caller(1))[3], <u></u>PACKAGE__;
    public(@_);
  }

</pre>
Including these methods at the top of your class will allow you to abbreviate method classes: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub set_x {
    private @_, sub {
      $x = shift;
    };
  }

</pre>
Call public() or private() with the arguments and a subroutine to execute.  public() will run the passed subroutine unconditionally, while private() will  only run it if your method was invoked from within the object. If another object  or package tries to invoke your private method directly, it will generate an error message: <br><br>
<pre>
  Cannot invoke private method <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Yawn/">Yawn</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Yawn::setb_x">setb_x</a> from outside Yawn at foo.pl line 17.

</pre>
Additionally, you don't need to say $me->{'x'} to get at your "x" field: you can  refer to it directly as $x. For each value in the object hash, a local temporary  alias is set up with the same name. $this is set to $me in the same way, which is similar to what other languages provide. <br><br>
Even this is tedious: you have to repeat code at the top of each class, and the  syntax for declaring an accessor isn't natural.  You could of course use <i>require</i> to read it in from a module that doesn't use <i>package</i> to change the namespace, in the Perl 4 fashion. I like local customizations, and if I wanted to take the above code and start melding it, thats exactly what I would do. I've done that and gone one step further: I've put it into a regular module and grafted  some logic onto it that avoids having to use any strange syntax at all in your modules. The program <a href="#footnote37">[37]</a> <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>.pm gives you all of these features: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Foo;

  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>;
  <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/ImplicitThis/">ImplicitThis</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=ImplicitThis::imply">imply</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my %options = @_;
    my $me = { x => $options{'x'}, y => $options{'y'}};
    bless $me, $type;
  }

  sub <u>set</u>x {
    $x = $shift;
  }

  sub get_x {
    return $x;
  } 

</pre>
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/ImplicitThis/">ImplicitThis</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=ImplicitThis::imply">imply</a>() is called separately because <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>.pm needs to  wait until your package finishes loading before taking action. When imply() is  run, it looks through your name table, finds all of the functions, and puts a  thin wrapper around them. The wrapper creates temporary aliases to all of the  instance variables, once again giving them the same name. <br><br>
Since the "public" and "private" keywords are gone now, the convention of using  functions starting with underscores as private functions is used. If a function  starts with an underscore, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ImplicitThis">ImplicitThis</a>.pm checks the call stack using caller()  to make sure that the call originated from within the package. <br><br>
This isn't a real Design Pattern. It does make Perl objects more usable and natural, so I'm giving it special attention. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="StaticVariables"><h2>StaticVariables</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: Some classes rely on values that will never change within the  execution of the program, and putting these values into a global variable where  they can be define once at the top of the module is good enough. No special work  is needed to do this, but passing the set of fixed values to the constructor of each new object is definitely overkill. <br><br>
When: A Factory needs to keep track of what it produces, and also be a sort of  container for them ("has a" relationship). You need serial numbers attached to  each thing produced. All of the objects are dependent upon a single other object  or variable which we aren't worried about changing. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?SerialNumbered">SerialNumbered</a>;
  
  my $globalSerialNumber;
  
  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    $serialNumber++;
    my $me = {@_, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?SerialNumber">SerialNumber</a>=>$serialNumber}; 
    bless $me, type;
  }
  
</pre>
This example keeps a serial number in a variable. Every object has access to this, in addition to their own "SerialNumber" instance variable. <br><br>
In C, a "static" variable is one that gets its own place in memory. It isn't lost  when the function its declared in return. This idea has been extended to Objects.  Static variables aren't associated with any perticular object, but are shared  between all of them. Declaring a variable outside of functions in a package  gives you this behavior. Because we're using a "my" variable, code outside of  our package can't access the variable directly. If it were a local, they could,  but they would have to jump through a few hoops: <br><br>
<pre>
  print ${ref($obj).'::globalSerialNumber'};

</pre>
This assumes that $obj is an object of type <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?SerialNumbered">SerialNumbered</a>, and $globalSerialNumber were a "local" instead of a "my" variable. <br><br>
This example assumes that serial numbers must be globally unique accrost the program.  Assumptions about only ever having one of a thing are genereally bad. Perl threads  are based on Perl's support for being able to embed multiple interpreters in  another program. To remove this limitation from the example, you could beak that  program into two objects. One would have an instance variable holding the serial  number and use it to generate copies of the second object. <br><br>

Synopsis: Seperate what you do and how you do it by putting up a barrier around your data. <br><br>
The purpose of your module is set in stone - other code in the program expectations of it. Other code should not have expectations on how you do it.  We aren't barring them, just putting up a hoop and asking them to jump.  Cleanliness is our main goal - not security. <a href="#footnote38">[38]</a> <br><br>
In <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> lingo, a <i>mutator</i> is an accessor that changes the state of an object, for example by setting an InstanceVariable<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InstanceVariable">+</a>. A mutator is called to request that the state of the object change rather than  accessing the datastructure directly. Guarding access to our data with mutators lets us: <a href="#footnote39">[39]</a> <br><br>
<li> Validate the data given to us <li> Update our internal state <li> Notify other objects or even hardware of the update <li> Change how we use the data without modification to outside code. <br><br>
<i>Choose mnemonic identifiers. If you can't remember what mnemonic means, you've got a problem.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LarryWall">LarryWall</a> <br><br>
This last point is the most import: accessors are most of our interface. Seperate the interface from the implementation, and the implementation can change  without affecting the interface.  Our code can safely be changed without worry of breaking outside code as long as we meet the contract set forth by our interface. See <a href="#DesignContract">DesignContract</a>. <a href="#footnote40">[40]</a> <br><br>
Should people meddle in the internals of your object, you must provide backwards compatability with every bit that gets diddled or risk breaking other peoples code - even if you have no way of knowing what people are diddling. <br><br>
<b>Writing Accessors is Tedious</b> <br><br>
In many strictly <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> languages, a large amount of repetitious  code is needed just to set up the accessors. While some accessors will vary,  most of them fit the mould of a <i>set_whatever()</i> and <i>get_whatever()</i>,  where "whatever" is the name of a variable.  Perl holds true the notion that computers should do tedious things for us. <a href="#footnote41">[41]</a>. <br><br>
<pre>
  foreach my $i (qw(name price quantity)) {
    my $field = $i;
    *{"get_$field"} = sub {
      my $me = shift;
      return $me->{$field};
    };
    *{"set_$field"} = sub {
      my $me = shift;
      @_ or die "not enough arguments to set_$field, stopped";
      $me->{$field} = shift;
      return 1;
     };
  }

</pre>
For each of "name", "price" and "quantity", we create an anonymous subroutine that binds to the current state of <i>my</i> variables. This is called a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosure">LambdaClosure</a> - see <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LexicalsMakeSense">LexicalsMakeSense</a>. We go on to name these by dropping them into the symbol table using the glob syntax. They then work as normal methods. When invoked, they are still bound to the variable that was created with <i>my</i> when they were created in the <i>for</i> loop. They're able to use this variable to pick out the correct field.  <a href="#footnote42">[42]</a>  <br><br>
<b>ObjectOriented Syntax is Tedious</b> <br><br>
Another option is to step inside of another object and access the variable  directly. When we do this, we use knowledge about the underlining datatype  used to construct the object, in this case a hash:  <br><br>
<pre>
  $stock->{'price'} *= 2;

  # Rather than the more OO:

  $stock->set_price($stock->get_price() * 2);

</pre>
Of course, if anyone does that to our neat little package, they void the warranty.  Having an accessor, even if it is just a stand-in for having access to the variables directly, keeps our options open about changing our implementation, and thats what this is all about. <br><br>
Perhaps that isn't really best, though. One of the most annoying spectacles  heavy Object Oriented code makes is the accessor bonanza: <br><br>
<pre>
  $foo->query_ob()->add($baz->query_qux());

</pre>
The only operator this code uses is <i>-></i>, the method call operator. Compare this to normal, non <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> code: <br><br>
<pre>
  $foo{ob}->{bar} += $baz{qux};

</pre>
While the basic arithmetic, logic, and other operators represented by symbols  in languages (especially in Perl) account for 99% of what people want to do at  any given moment, reading OO code gives you the impression that the only one  that hasn't been robbed of its usefulness is the -> operator.  <br><br>
You have to fetch everything you want to do a computation on into a variable, do your  operation, then use an accessor to stow this value away where it belongs. <a href="#footnote43">[43]</a> <br><br>
This is the main reason <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> languages are seldom expressive. Expressive languages let you communicate your thoughts readily to the compiler. Not being able to use the <i>+=</i> operator to tell the language that you want to add is a serious impedement to self expression.. <br><br>
<b>Accessors vs L<a href="#InstanceVariables">InstanceVariablesL</a>, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Accessors</b> <br><br>
<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?JamieZawinski">JamieZawinski</a>, of Netscape fame, observently complained that distinguishing  between accessing object methods and object instance variables required large  amounts of code to be rewritten when you switch from using one to the other. <a href="#footnote44">[44]</a> It isn't unusual at all for a programmer to start out with a publically accessable instance variable and later discover the need to wrap it inside of an accessor: <br><br>
<pre>
  # before: direct access to instance variable

  $ob->{foo};         # Perl
  ob->foo             # Java

  # after: using an accessor

  $ob->foo()          # Perl
  ob->foo()           # Java

</pre>
In Perl, style dictates that all variables have accessors, and that instance variables never be diddled directly. Both of these pose the problem of differing syntax for instance variables versus method calls. The uselessness of all operators except <i>-></i> is a closely replated problem. <br><br>

A lot of this is out of the scope of this chapter. You can read on, you can  employ faith and cut and paste this into your code, or you can just rest  assured that there is a solution to the "-> is the only useful operator" problem. <br><br>
If you're dying to know what this is all about, the variables that really hold  the values are $name_value, $color_value, etc. What we store in the hash that  we bless to represent our object is $me->{name}, $me->{color}, etc, don't cease  being when they goes out of scope. $me holds a "reference" to them, and we  return $me. Another way to put that is, Perl doesn't get rid of $me->{name}  and $me->{color} as long as someone can still see them, and since they are  returned as part of our objects, someone can still see them. That is, until no  one can see our object. Then there are no references to our object, it gets  thrown away, then there are no references to our code references, and they get  thrown away. In exactly the same way, as long as $me->{color} and $me->{name}  are visible to someone, somewhere, $name_value and $color_value will continue  to live on. Datastructures hold references to variables like this: <br><br>
<pre>
  $datastructure{'color'} = \$color;

</pre>
The backslash operator takes a reference of a scalar, hash, array, etc. We store this reference in something else. Code, created by with the sub { } mechanism, can store references, too. It looks a little bit different: <br><br>
<pre>
  my $foo_value;
  my $foo_logic = sub {
    # code
    $foo_value;
    # code
  };

</pre>
There are two secret ingredients to make this work. First, the value that we  want to keep a reference to in our code must be declared using "my". Second,  we use that variable normally in our sub { } block from a place where that  variable is visible. This is before the end of the code block that the variable  was defined in - be it a subroutine, eval, do. If it was defined outside of any  of those, it is visible until the end of the file. If we define $color_value and  $name_value inside of the subroutines, they would get created each time these  subroutines are evaluated, then forgotten when they returned. By declaring the  variables outside, the subroutines hold on to already existing variables, and  they retain their values from call to call. Thats really all there is to it! <br><br>
The arrangement that we have now is that we return a hash reference. This hash reference has references to two blocks of code, where each block  of code has reference to a variable. We aren't just assigning them. We could  say $me->{'color'} = sub { ... } if we wanted to do that. Instead, we tie them. Tying is like blessing, but different. Blessing lets you use the -> operator  on a reference. Tying lets you intercept attempts to fetch values from and  assign values to a variable. When someone attempts to fetch the value of the  variable, using any Perl operator, we get to pick the value returned. Likewise,  when someone assigns a value, using any Perl operator, we get to look at what  they are trying to store in us and decide what to do with it. Even *=, +=, /=,  etc work. <br><br>
This buys us a few things: <br><br>
1. To do an operation on two values, each of which are buried in different objects, we don't have to declare intermediate variables. XXX test this - not sure if lvalue assignments to tied variables work ;) <br><br>
<pre>
  $ob->get_value() += $ob->query_value() * $economy->query_inflation();

</pre>
2. If someone completely bypasses our accessors, it doesn't matter one bit: our logic still runs. <br><br>
<pre>
  $ob->{'color'} = 'blue'; # this blows up because we're able to trap it

</pre>

Perl is a "weakly typed" language. A variable may hold a string, number, or  reference, including an object reference. This leads to debugging code strewn around the program: <br><br>
<pre>
  die unless $ob->isa('Number::Complex');

  or more typically:

  if(!$ob || $ob->error) {
    print "well that didnt work\n";
  }

</pre>
When variables are created to hold exactly one datatype, we often do a lot of  checking to make sure thats the case. This clutters up code. Perl is difficult enough to understand without clutter. <br><br>

This is "runtime type checking". Some languages do this checking at compile  time. If we had that, it would prevent the program from ever reaching the "die"  point: if it were even possible to reach it, the program wouldn't compile. <br><br>

When you write something yourself, you can usually remember what parts of  objects you plan to keep around and which parts you want to keep open to  revision. You may, on the other hand, completely forget this, or collaborate  with other programmers. This gets you stuck in the trap of having to keep making  your object exactly the same way. OO says that the implementation should be  separate from the interface. Opting to not allow foreign code to access your  internals buys you privacy and freedom to change around your internals. <br><br>

Define logic early on that subclasses are likely subclasses are likely to be  needed. This minimizes the need for Facades or multiple inheritance to graft  features on later, and they can always be redefined in subclasses. Define  data only when needed:  it costs, and ambigiously unneeded data creates room for  inconsistant program state, which is bad. Encapsulate the data in an object and  use the <a href="#VisitorPattern">VisitorPattern</a>. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="AbstractClass"><h2>AbstractClass</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem:  Several objects should be of the same basic type, as they are interchangeable, though they will have different implementations. <br><br>
Solution:  Implement the service differently in each subclass, but provide the same interface. Use one or more "empty" objects as parents to create common base types. <br><br>
<b>Abstract Class Is...</b> <br><br>
<li> Objects are user-defined datatypes. <li> One object can serve as any number of different object types as enforced by <i>->isa()</i>. <li> Testing for the presence of an Interface allows a running program to deturmine if an object offers certain features. <li> An Interface, or API, is a specification of features that doesn't include any actual implementation of the features. <li> Interfaces are defined by <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AbstractClasses">AbstractClasses</a>. <br><br>
<b>Formula</b> <br><br>
<li> Create an empty base package and inherit it from each interchangeable module using <i>use base</i> or <i>@ISA</i>. <i>use interface</i> or a similar mechanism to do compile-time checking to catch API omissions.  <li> Create stub methods in the base class to document the required methods and to generate meaningful warnings if they aren't implemented in the subclass. <br><br>
<b>Logic</b> <br><br>
Having an interface, or extending a real class is basically the same idea:  put the new class or interface in the @ISA array, and you offer all of the  methods required to be a working version of that class. Normally this is not a  problem - the base class takes care of everything. Some base classes only  contain stubs for methods, and leave it up to you to implement something useful for each of them. This is an <a href="#AbstractClass">AbstractClass</a>, or "Pure Virtual Class". An  Abstract Class defines an "Interface". <br><br>
<b>Motivations</b> <br><br>
<li> <a href="#TypeSafety">TypeSafety</a> <li> Polymorphism <br><br>
<b>Section</b> <br><br>
Some times you will see Abstract Classes define an Interface with nothing in  it. Any class in the world can automatically meet the expectations of an empty  interface merely by including mention of the Abstract Class in its @ISA array.  This is a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MarkerInterface">MarkerInterface</a>. It tells the world that the object can do something,  or be used in a certain way that does not directly translate to which methods  it defines. It could mark the class as being "lightweight", telling the world  that its okay to create a million instances of it. It could be used to tell the  world that the object is safe to store with Storable. <br><br>
Inheriting empty classes can be used as a simple, cheap way to set attributes  on objects. It can mark two classes as being the same base type so they can be  used interchangeably (polymorphism).  <br><br>
Why bother? Lets say you have a web based shopping cart, as so many programmers  do. You can add objects to it. These objects may return thier price, weight,  name, description, and an image when queried. You start off with one kind of  object - lets say, ink jet cartridges. So far, so good. <br><br>
<pre>
  package Item;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    $me->{name} = $args{name};
    $me->{price} = $args{price};
    $me->{image} = $args{image};
    $me->{description} = $args{description};
    $me->{weight} = $args{weight};
  }
  
  foreach my $i (qw(name price weight desciption image)) {
    # create accessor
  }
  
</pre>
Then the store adds paper, toner, refill kits, cables, dye sublimation ink,  impact ribbons, and new ribbons. Then the store starts giving discounts for  toner and inkjet cartridge returns. Then you're asked to give warnings if  someone tries to buy a new printer with the wrong kind of paper or ink. Fields  are introduced to specify compatibilty and compatibility requirements, as well  as return discount amout and eligability.  <br><br>
Since each type of object is doing something a little different, you make them  seperate objects. You've lain the original Item class to rest in favor of  Printer, Toner, Ink, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InkRefill">InkRefill</a>, Paper, etc classes. Years later, another  programmer comes along and adds donations to a good cause (matched by the store)  that users may buy. Unaware of the ugliness behind the cart, he adds the name,  price, weight, decription, and image fields. Everything seems to work fine  until someone tries to buy a printer and thc cart calls compatability($printerob)  in his object to find out if that item is compatable with that printer. This  method isn't found, and the program blows up. <br><br>
By reintroducing Item.pm as an object full of empty methods, and using  interface.pm to declare Item.pm as an interface in Toner.pm, Paper.pm,  Donation.pm, Ink.pm, and <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InkRefill">InkRefill</a>.pm, we know right away if a module has  failed to define a needed method. We don't need to wait for a good testing, or  worse: a user finds it before we do. This is "design by contract": because of  the interface contract, we know exactly which methods need to be implemented,  not because we were told, but because the system requires it by refusing to  compile. The objects in question can be used interchangeably - we're garunteed of it. <br><br>
Explicitly using, then adding to @ISA, a marker interface is kind of ugly. One  solution is to move part of the work to the abstract marker class: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Item;

  sub import {
    push @{caller().'::ISA'}, <u></u>PACKAGE__;
  }

</pre>
Viola! Whenever anyone uses Item.pm, their package will be marked as being  (is-a) Item. Should that object ever be tested with ->isa('Item'), it will come  back true. We have this one bit of @ISA munging logic in the abstract marker  class rather than: <br><br>
<pre>
  use Item;
  push @ISA, 'Item';

</pre>
...floating around everywhere.  <br><br>
A quick and dirty trick for  A base class could abuse its <i>import()</i> method to do compile-time interface (API) checking. Since <i>import()</i> gets called while the <i>use</i> for that module is being processed and before the <i>use</i>'ing module is allowed to run, it has a perfect chance to steal that CPU-share (kind of like mind-share) to do some checking and discover if any of the stub methods aren't in fact being redefined. <br><br>
<pre>
  # example of making sure that an interface is implemented

  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?FooAbstractClass">FooAbstractClass</a>; # rename this with your abstract class

  sub import {
    my $caller = caller;
    eval "use $caller;"; # let them finish loading
    foreach my $i (grep { defined &{$_} } keys %{__PACKAGE__.'::'}) {
      die <u></u>PACKAGE__ . " is listed as a base type in $caller, but the $i method is not implemented!"
        unless defined &{$caller.'::'.$i};
    }
  }

</pre>
interface.pm by yours truly (look for it on CPAN) implements compile-time interface checking in Perl, similar to the example above, merely with a cleaner interface itself: <br><br>
<pre>
  use interface 'Class::Struct', 'Clonable';

</pre>
This tells Perl that we must define all of the methods listed in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Class/">Class</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Class::Struct">Struct</a>  as well as Clonable. If we fail to, we don't compile, and we don't run.  <br><br>
<b>Interface Design Guidelines</b> <br><br>
<li> Don't bundle unrelated operations in a single method. Methods shouldn't have bizarre side effects when used from the perspective of wanting one or the other feature. <li> Few is usually better than more. Should new functionality be needed in the future, it can be defined by an interface, then implemented by whichever modules it is appropriate for, or even added directly to the base parent class. <li> The few operations should combine well. This means creating and returning objects that can be directly used by other accessors and other objects. <li> Objects of the same type should combine well. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?OverloadPattern">OverloadPattern</a> can be employed to define the combinatrics of how two objects interact. If operator overloading isn't desired, think in terms of operating overloading. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?EqualsInterface">EqualsInterface</a>, AggreatePattern<a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AggreatePattern">+</a> <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="TemplateMethod"><h2>TemplateMethod</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Each subclass changes details of an otherwise identical method. <br><br>
Solution: Implement the essential framework of the method in the superclass and use <i>$this->foo()</i> to access the bits and peices that vary by subclass. <br><br>
Even though you can override methods in subclasses, the base classes won't use your new methods by default: <br><br>
<pre>
  # redefining compute_gcd() in a sublass won't affect this code
  $gcd = compute_gcd($x, $y);     

</pre>
They will continue using the methods and functions defined in the same class as themselves, unless they go out of their way: <br><br>
<pre>
  # this will use the top-most version of compute_gcd() 
  $gcd = $this->compute_gcd($x, $y); 

</pre>
A method that does some work, but passes off sub-tasks using the -> syntax is  said to be a "template method". This method forms the basis for an operation,  but is open-ended. Its behavior can be tailored, customized and specialized in subclasses. This aids in code re-use. <br><br>
In order for the class to be used, either default implementations must be provided, or someone must subclass it and fill in the missing methods required by the code in the base class. <br><br>
Template methods can be used with <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MixIns">MixIns</a>, even outside of objects: <br><br>
<pre>
  package main;

  our $this = <u></u>PACKAGE__;

  sub template_records {
    my @records = $this->query_records();
    foreach my $record (@records) {
      $this->per_record($record);
      my $output = $this->template_record($record);
      $this->save_record($output);
    }
  }

  sub per_record {
    # do nothing
  }

  sub query_records {
    # default implementation
  }

  sub template_record {
    # populate a template with data from $record
  }

  sub save_record {
    # save $output to disc
  }

</pre>
We write this code as a normal program, with no special or even ordinary object-orientedness. Its not in a package. It wasn't created from a constructor. We can't handle multiple instances of our program. The only thing we need to take advantage of template methods is the <i>$this->method()</i> syntax itself. We can fake having an object instance with the <i>our $this = __PACKAGE__;</i> gambit. <u></u>PACKAGE__ always contains the name of the current package for the module its in. Rather than access an instance of the  class, we access the definition of the class directly.  <br><br>
When the time comes to add customizations for a single client, the changes are dropped in without affecting the behavior of the original, though perhaps we will need to break out more logic from the main <i>template_records()</i> routine. <br><br>
<pre>
  # in <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MegaCorp">MegaCorp</a>.pm:

  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MegaCorp">MegaCorp</a>;

  our $this = <u></u>PACKAGE__;
  @ISA = qw(main);

  sub per_record {
    my $this = shift;
    my $record = shift;
    if($record->{price} == 0) {
      $record->{availability} = "Sold Out";
    }
  }

  1;

</pre>
We load up the original code, but we also load up <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MegaCorp">MegaCorp</a>.pm, and thats what we use. It barrows all of the logic from the original, but makes some changes to it.  The best part is that we can create any number of modules like this and share the main code between all of them. The same code can work different ways for each client, project, customer, and so on. <br><br>
The normal mode of the <a href="#TemplateMethod">TemplateMethod</a> is that we expect to be inherited and have things overridden on a fine scale. The flip side of the coin is the module that inherits us. These are two sides of the same coin, so to speak: coming at the same problem from two angles to make things better. <br><br>
<i>A subtle phenomenon occurs in traditional programming languages:  While writing the program for '<Issue an error message and try to recover>', a programmer subconsciously tries to get by with the fewest possible lines of code, in cases where the program for '<Update the code structure>' is quite short. For if an extensive error recovery were actually programmed, the subroutine would appear to hvae error-message printing as its main purpose. The programmer knows that the error is really an exceptional case that arises only rarely; therefore a lengthy error recovery doesn't look right, and most programmers will minimize it (without raelizing they are doing so) in order to make the subroutine appearance match its intended behavior.</i> - <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DonaldKnuth">DonaldKnuth</a>, in <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LiterateProgramming">LiterateProgramming</a> <br><br>
This highlights another benefit: the purpose of the routine is immediately obvious, while nit-picky details are farmed out. Routines can be composed to resemble what they do to a greater degree and how they do it to a  lesser degree. <br><br>
A permutation of the <a href="#TemplateMethod">TemplateMethod</a> is the "abstract template method".  Used when a base class provides a case so general that there is no default behavior. This may well describe most cases. <i>map { }</i> is a simple example: a code block is applied to each item in the input list, and the collected results are returned as a new array. Only the strucure is defined: what is actually done to each array element is left to the user to specify via a code block. <i>map { }</i> takes the codeblock as an argument, rather than calling a method with a fixed name.  Programmers used to the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaClosure">LambdaClosure</a> style of programming will find <i>map { }</i> more natural. Indeed, it is identical to the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> style with few exceptions:  <br><br>
<li> Callbacks are named, as arguments, before the template method is invoked rather than hardcoded, by name, inside of it. <li> Code references passed explicitly to be called back negate the need for <i>$this</i> to point to the current object. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ReusableFunctions"><h2>ReusableFunctions</h2><br> <br><br>
Synopsis: You've broken your program down into private functions in an object.  Go one step further by removing assumptions about the data they operate on.  In general, public methods in your code should decide what data the private  methods will work on, not the private methods themselves. <br><br>
When: You're writing private support methods for an object that both contains  logic and data, and the names of instance variables are coded into functions you've factored out. <br><br>
Putting related code and data in an object away from unrelated code and data is  often done to clean up a program. Not everything is going to be a public method:  your object will have functions it uses. Consider the function almost an object  of its own. Don't let it attach to data, but rather provide the data to it.  Instead of having it access a field or global variable directly, pass the value  in, when reasonable. At some point, someone must reference the variable directly.  This should be done at the level that would cause it to be done least often in  the code. Accessing global and method variables by name at the lowest level over  and over again makes it difficult to reuse the same code when assumptions built  into the code change. <br><br>

The full listing is available at XXX. <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/WebsafeColors/">WebsafeColors</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=WebsafeColors::Iterator">Iterator</a> implements all of  the functions required to be an instance of Iterator. If something takes an  argument, and insists it implement Iterator, it will accept the result of  calling getIterator() on a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebsafeColors">WebsafeColors</a> object. However, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebsafeColors">WebsafeColors</a> itself  does not implement these methods, or inherit the base abstract class for Iterators.  The package that does is contained entirely inside <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebsafeColors">WebsafeColors</a>'s getIterator()  method. This technique lets you localize the impact of having to provide an interface,  and keep code related to supporting that interface together and away from the  rest of the code. This supports the basic idea of putting code where it belongs. <br><br>
When we return a <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/WebsafeColors/">WebsafeColors</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=WebsafeColors::Iterator">Iterator</a> object, that object uses a variable  defined lexically inside <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebsafeColors">WebsafeColors</a>. Since defined lexically (contained inside  the block, in this case, the method) to the variable $parentThis, we hold a  reference to it. If it changes, we see the changes. If the parent is destroyed  before the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/WebsafeColors/">WebsafeColors</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=WebsafeColors::Iterator">Iterator</a> object we return is, this variable will live  on until all references are destroyed. This way, we can share data efficiently  with our parent. In some situations, it may be better to copy the data before  giving it to the inner class, or to use Immutable Objects, explained in Chapter XXX. <br><br>
Our Perl implementation could cause problems if two threads contend for the same  datastructure, even by way of different objects. Thus, if used in a threading  environment, the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WebsafeColors">WebsafeColors</a> and all of its returned inner classes would need  to synchronize on the same object for access to the array of colors. Failure to  do so would lead to iterators that miss colors, end prematurely, or overrun the  array. <br><br>

More importantly, you can test objects for equality using a benchmark other than rather or not the two pointers reference the exact same object. <br><br>
More operations can be overloaded as well: most require that a new object be created and returned. For example, overloading addition requires this be done.  <br><br>

We can inherit this, but inheriting it multiple times doesn't do us any good:  we only ever have one instance of the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LinkedList">LinkedList</a> this way - ourselves. Using  composition gives us what we want: <br><br>
<pre>

  # create accessors that defer the action to each object, for each object composing us:

  sub get_save_order { return $save_order; }

</pre>
Where it says "method A" and "method B" illustrate two very different approaches  to giving users of our object access to the our parts. "Method A" creates all  new accessors which do their work by calling accessors in the composing objects.  "Method B" simply returns the composing objects and lets the user call the  methods directly. For example: <br><br>
<pre>
  # using method A:

  $ob->next_sort($ob2);

  # using method B:

  $ob->get_sort_order()->set_next($ob2);

</pre>
Which is better? Well, it depends. If your object is merely a container for  other objects, B makes more sense. If your object is a Facade, providing a new  interface to several objects, A makes more sense. If you consider the objects  you contain to be implementation dependent, and you don't want to have to support  returning intermediate objects in the future, A lets you hide your implementation  better. B makes for shorter code and less typing when the relationship between the  objects isn't likely to change. <br><br>
Each <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LinkedList">LinkedList</a> instance is a "delegate" in this example. The methods that propogate requests to them are "delegate methods". <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="ExportingPattern"><h2>ExportingPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Problem: Creating an object to get at functions defined by its package is overkill for most situations, and requires extra typing. <br><br>
Solution: Export functions that are implicitly attached to a  single default object instance. Users of the package need only  call the function names, not instantiate objects, or type the object name over and over. <br><br>
<a href="#CompositePattern">CompositePattern</a> tells us to build complex objects out of simplier ones using delegation. Some times complex relationships are expressed where one object of one type can refer to several objects of another type.  In the simple case where we only need one instance of another object, Exporting works fine. <br><br>
<pre>
  # a module that exports:

  use Foo;
  foo("module Foo does something with this");

  # a module that doesn't export:

  use Bar;
  my $bar = new Bar;
  $bar->do_something("module Bar does something with this");

</pre>
If you're only reasonably going to be using one instance of a "Bar" object, why go through the hassle of giving it a name ($bar)? Which object we're talking  about when we say do_something("bar!") is unambiguous as well - we only have  one Bar object to call it in. The handiness of the first approach is so loved  that many modules that provide a strictly OO interface (as in the second  example, Bar) also provide a syntactical sugar, exporter interface as well (as  in the first example). This is accessed, by convention, as: <br><br>
<pre>
  use Bar qw(do_something);
  do_something("module Bar does something without a lot of typing, just like Foo!");

</pre>
Here, we tell Bar just to make the method do_something() available to us. If  Bar creates a single instance of an object behind the scenes, so be it - we  never have to know. <br><br>
<pre>
  package Bar;

  sub import {
    my $caller = caller;
    my $foo;
    my $bar;
    my %methods = (
      get_foo = sub { $foo;  },
      set_foo = sub { $foo = shift; },
      get_bar = sub { $bar; },
      set_bar = sub { $bar = shift; },
      do_something =  sub { $foo . ' and ' . $bar . ' sitting in a tree... ' },
    );
    foreach my $i (keys %methods) {
      *{$caller.'::'.$i} = $methods{$i};
    }
  }

  1;

</pre>
This example uses <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LexicallyScopedVariables">LexicallyScopedVariables</a> to generate a scalar for each package that imports our logic. In other words, if multiple packages <i>use Bar</i>, each gets copies of <i>set_foo()</i>, <i>get_foo()</i>, <i>do_something()</i>, and so on, but each package has its own private values for <i>$foo</i> and <i>$bar</i> used by these functions. One packages actions won't step on another packages data. <br><br>
This example provides one unique set of data for each package that uses it, but neglects the case where a package might want more than one instance. It also neglects the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> interface. Lets fix that: <br><br>
<pre>
  package Bar;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $foo;
    my $bar;
    my $object = {
      get_foo = sub { $foo;  },
      set_foo = sub { $foo = shift; },
      get_bar = sub { $bar; },
      set_bar = sub { $bar = shift; },
      do_something =  sub { $foo . ' and ' . $bar . ' sitting in a tree... ' },
    };
    bless $type, $object;
  }

  sub import {
    my $caller = caller;
    my $methods = <u></u>PACKAGE__->new();
    foreach my $i (keys %$methods) {
      *{$caller.'::'.$i} = $methods->{$i};
    }
  }

  sub AUTOLOAD {
    my $me = shift; 
    (my $method) = $AUTOLOAD =~ m/::(.*)$/; 
    return undef if $method eq 'DESTROY';
    return wantarray() ? ($me->{$method}->(@_)) : scalar $me->{$method}->(@_);
  }

  1;

</pre>
We're coming in from a lot of angles at once here, but it still isn't very much code. Our former <i>import()</i> logic found its way into <i>new()</i>, with a few changes: we're using a hash reference instead of a hash, and we're blessing it as an object.  This object is exceptional: instead of merely containing variables, it contains  anonymous code references. These anonymous code references are lexically bound to their data, exactly like our former example. Perl doesn't know how to  use this kind of an object, but thankfully we can teach it: the <i>AUTOLOAD()</i> method is used to look up methods on demand. This should be invoked for every method call except for <i>new()</i>, since no other methods are defined. When it is invoked, we get our hash reference passed in, and to get at our anonymous subroutine reference we tucked away in the hash reference, use this syntax: <br><br>
<pre>
  $me->{$method}->(@_);

</pre>
This looks up the method, by name, in our hash reference, then calls it as a subroutine, passing the current argument list. Viola! A new sort of object that keeps a hash reference of code lexically bound to data rather than just plain old boring data. <br><br>
<i>import()</i> merely uses <i>new()</i> to cook up a hash full of code references for the module that is <i>use</i>ing it. Even though an object comes back, we know how to probe the internals of the object to extract the code references. We drop these code references directly into our callers name space, thus giving them names: <br><br>
<pre>
  *{$caller.'::'.$i} = $methods->{$i};

</pre>
Assinging to a glob (variables that start with an asterisk) is special. Perl figures out what to do with the value we're assigning. If we assign a scalar reference to <i>*whatever</i>,  it becomes available as <i>$whatever</i>. If we assign a hash reference to <i>*whatever</i>, Perl makes it available as <i>%whatever</i>. If we assign a code reference to <i>*whatever</i>, it appears as <i>whatever()</i>. We take advantage of this to define functions not in our namespace, but the namespace of the package calling our <i>import()</i> routine. If you examine <i>Exporter.pm</i>, you'll find that this is exactly what it does. <br><br>
Lets review what we have here: <br><br>
<li> Importing the module automatically creates one default object <li> Each package importing the module has its own private data <li> Multiple objects can be created and named <li> Heavy use of lexicals makes the code very concise <br><br>

CGI.pm, a standard Perl module, does something similar with reguards to creating a single default object and also providing an OO interface. <br><br>
<br><br> <a name="ImportPattern"><h2>ImportPattern</h2><br> <br><br>
Not all packages exist solely to create objects. In fact, looking at most code,  you would never know that it was using objects, even though you clearly see  "use" statements at the top of the code. Import/export is a facility many  objects provide to use features they provide with a non-OO interface. This is  often the best solution for packages that add new features or abilities, like  error handling, that applies to the whole program, doesn't contain information,  and doesn't make sense to have copies of. Many Perl core modules like CGI.pm,  offer both an OO interface and a non-OO interface. <br><br>
When Perl is parsing a program file and finds a "use" statement, it stops in  its tracks. The used module might offer features needed to finish compiling.  Perl goes off to load the new required module. As soon as it is loaded, Perl  calls the import() method. This gives the module a chance to modify the state  of the Perl interpreter (in the case of pragmas, like "use strict"), to export  functions, or what ever else. It also allows you to insist on a certain level  of features in Perl when used with a number: <br><br>
<pre>
  use 5.9.34;
  print "Perl 6 should be just about ready by now!\n";

</pre>
To write a module that exports functions when use'd, the Exporter offers a convinient way: <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PrintLN">PrintLN</a>;
  use Exporter;
  @ISA = qw(Exporter);

  @EXPORT = qw(println);                 # symbols to export by default
  @EXPORT_OK = qw(printpf);              # symbols to export on request

  sub println { print @_, "\n"; }        # print a line with a line feed
  sub printpf { print @_, chr(0x0c); }   # print a line with a page feed

</pre>
Functions named in @EXPORT always get exported to the program that uses us.  They can use them (almost) just like normal built in Perl functions. Functions  listed in @EXPORT_OK must be requested: <br><br>
<pre>
  package main;
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PrintPL">PrintPL</a> qw(printpf);

  printpf("This page intentionally left blank.");

</pre>
You could do the same thing manually, of course. Define an import method in your module, like so: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub import  {
    *{caller().'::printpf'} = sub { 
      print @_, chr(0x0c); 
    };
  }

</pre>
This doesn't have a lot to do with Object Oriented programming. It is a staple of Perl programming, so we need to know about it. <br><br>
"use" also checks a modules version number, as stored in $VERSION, for you: <br><br>
<pre>
  use CGI 2.4;

</pre>
This will die unless $CGI::VERSION >= 2.4. Perl checks the target module's  $VERSION package global variable variable and verifies that it is equal to or  greater than the number you specify. Perl understands "ordinals", comparing 2.4.1  against 2.4.2 does the right thing: 2.4.2 is larger. <br><br>

  FORK & MERGE

</pre>
Divirging copies happen. Refactoring, taken to an extreme, says to refactor the shared module into existance. Is what is good for one program good for another? We don't know, not before hand. A top-down approach fails here.  <br><br>
Copying the module and hacking it up lets us reevaluate the assumptions the module was created under. Should it do more? Less? Different? Making changes to the original is tedious when we haven't yet decided exactly what changes need to be made, and we just want to experiment.  <br><br>
CVS (the Concurrent Versioning System) models both of these scenarios. You'll sometimes hear about the Linux kernel (for instance) "forking". In reference to the CVS tree (as opposed to a process), a decision has been made to go two seperate directions with the code at once. This flies in the face of Refactoring conventional wisdom, where only small, incremental, individually tested changes are made. We're violating the more sacred principle: <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?KeepItWorking">KeepItWorking</a>. We're breaking it apart and putting it back together. We're shuffing the past. CVS lets you track exactly what has changed from two divergent versions. Certain things will be moved to the "old" or "stable" branch: security fixes, bug fixes, and things of that ilk. Likewise, security and bug fixes in the old version are merged into the new version. The "stable" branch isn't the newest,  greatest version, but it doesn't contain large amounts of new, realtively untested code. Meanwhile, the new version starts to come together, passes its <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UnitTests">UnitTests</a>, if it has them, and is slowly adopted by users (the brave at first, and then the rest). <br><br>
Certainly any change can be made through incremental refactoring improvements in code. The power of making radical, sweeping changes or importing a large section of code that was developed independently can often justify  foregoing strict refactoring principles temporarily. <br><br>

<br><br> <a name="HowDoesPerlStackUp"><h2>HowDoesPerlStackUp</h2><br> <br><br>
How does Perl stack up against other OO languages? <br><br>
We've all heard the flame wars. They usually take the form "XXX langauge isn't really OO because it doesn't do YYY". Since objects were a new feature introduced in Perl 5, we can safely assume the language wasn't designed them in mind. There are many language features associated with objects. Some of them are critical. Some are handy. Some of them are considered better excluded. <br><br>
Polymorphic - object's methods are represented by different code. Perl does this. Objects may be used interchangeably and each object defines how it responds to different "messages" or method calls. This is perhaps the most important OO feature, and the first an aspiring OO language implements. <br><br>
Inheritance - being able to create generic prototypical objects and further define them between classes is called inheritance. There are two aspects to it - data inheritance and implementation inheritance. Perl implements implementation inheritance: subroutines defined in child classes override those in parent classes, and those that aren't overriden appear untouched in the child class. Classes defined in children aren't visible to their parents. The same isn't true of data. Child class and parent class data all gets lumped together in one big pool. Most OO languages - C++, Java, XXX implement both implementation and data inheritance. Also, instead of some variables being magically provided for by inheritance, you have to go through manual steps to read the datastructure representing the class and access fields in it. We attempt to address the problem of having to read "this" and the class variables manually, while XXX module attempts to deal with the problem of data inheritance. <br><br>
Multiple Inheritance - Perl implements a simple version of this, with a depth-first, left-hand-side recursion through the @ISA array. Languages that implement multiple inheritance are faced with a number of trade offs and problems when doing so: what if a class is inherited by two separate parent classes? Perl assumes that the first parent wins over the others in this case. C++ has a more complicated system for solving these problems, while Java opts out of allowing it at all.  <br><br>
Method Overloading - Most OO languages allow you to write various implementations of methods representing the different combinations of arguments that may be supplied. This way, you can do completely different things when passed a number, a string, an object of one type, an object of another type, and so on. This avoids using explicit case logic, a big OO no no. Perl doesn't offer this natively, but a module is available XXX. <br><br>
Operator Overloading - This refers to assigning different means to operators. Usually when this is done, an object may choose how it responds to having an operator used on it (as a whole). What happens if you add two objects? Only those objects can tell you. Perl lets the first object (the one on the left) decide how to handle the operation. The object on the right is employed if the thing on the left isn't an object. Perl does offer this feature, as does C++. Java elects not to because of historic abuses of it. Programs that use operators to perform operators across objects that have nothing to do with arithmetic quickly become incomprehensible.   <br><br>
Strongly Typed - This certainly doesn't describe Perl. Some language employ compile-time checking to make sure that no code anywhere attempts to pass anything not explicit accepted into any method. This makes a large class of run-time errors vanish in a puff of logic. Methods are assured that no unexpected object or data types will ever be passed to them. It doesn't rule out the case where the type of the object is expected but the range of the value or state of the object isn't acceptable. For this reason, some OO zealots argue that each possible state of an object should be a separate subclass of that object, and of course, numbers should be objects, too. C++ and Java both offer this, while Perl does not. <br><br>
Pure OO - this is considered extreme. Smalltalk, for instance, prides itself on representing everything with objects - even numeric constants like "3". This means you can make method calls into numbers. Languages that don't do this suffer from a sort of duality. Every time objects and non-objects interact, there are numerous possible scenarios describing the interaction. Handling these cases with type membership is much cleaner. Lacking this feature, programmers are steered in a mindset where the explicit cases are the norm. This is an Anti-Pattern. For example, my $res = $ob->call(); if(!$res) { ... } else { ... }. Java is not pure OO - primitive datatypes include numbers of various sorts, booleans, arrays, as well as object references. Perl is not pure OO either. I think Ruby is and Python is not XXX. <br><br>

<a href="#PerlDoc">PerlDoc</a> - also known as <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PlainOldDocumentation">PlainOldDocumentation</a> - is recognized by the Perl interpreter as comments, and is recognized by the <i>perldoc</i> program as documentation. <i>perldoc</i> generates manual pages from buried comments much as <i>javadoc</i> does for Java programs. <br><br>
<pre>
  <i>=pod</i>   Starts a chunk of documentation. The tags below are then valid.

  <i>=cut</i>   Ends a chunk of documentation, returns to code.

  <i>=head1 Heading</i>

       1st level header.

  <i>=head2 Heading</i> 

       2nd level header.

  <i>=over n</i>

       Starts an enumerated list indented <i>n</i> spaces. 

  <i>=item Text</i>

       A bullet item in an enumerated list.

  <i>=back</i>  

       Ends an enumerated list.

  <i>=begin FMT</i>

       Subsequent text up to a matching =end is only included when processed for formatter FMT.

  <i>=end FMT</i>

       End enumerated list.

  <i>=for FMT</i>

       Following paragraph is included conditionally if formatter FMT is used.

  <i>B<text></i> Bold - for command-line switches and program names.

  <i>C<code></i> Code

  <i>E<escape></i> Escape - Character names from HTML escape sequences, eg lt, gt, amp

  <i>F<filename></i> Filename

  <i>I<text></i> Italics

  <i>L<name></i> Link - Cross reference. 

      May be a URL, name of a man page, or the name of <i>=head1</i>, <i>=head2</i>, or <i>=item</i>.
      May contains optional quotes. A slash may be used to seperate the name of a man page from the section in the man page.

  <i>S<name></i> Non-breaking string - will not linewrap on spaces

  <i>X<index></i> Index entry.

</pre>
CPAN modules are expected to follow a certain format. <i>pod2man</i>, <i>pod2latex</i>, <i>pod2text</i>, <i>pod2html</i>, and <i>pod2usage</i> take advantage of this format to translate the embedded documentation into other standard formats. In this example, the lines starting with <i>=head1</i> are litteral and are not changed: the lines between them are. <br><br>

XXX the following information needs to be merged in to this explaination, and I need to devise a solution to the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MakeMaker">MakeMaker</a> problem. <br><br>
From perldoc perlmodstyle: <br><br>
<pre>
       If you want to release a 'beta' or 'alpha' version of a
       module but don't want CPAN.pm to list it as most recent
       use an '_' after the regular version number followed by at
       least 2 digits, eg. 1.20_01. If you do this, the following
       idiom is recommended:

         $VERSION = "1.12_01";
         $XS_VERSION = $VERSION; # only needed if you have XS code
         $VERSION = eval $VERSION;

       With that trick <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?MakeMaker">MakeMaker</a> will only read the first line
       and thus read the underscore, while the perl interpreter
       will evaluate the $VERSION and convert the string into a
       number. Later operations that treat $VERSION as a number
       will then be able to do so without provoking a warning
       about $VERSION not being a number.


</pre>
What actually gets put into files by h2xs: <br><br>
<pre>
  our $VERSION = '0.02';
  $VERSION = eval $VERSION;  # see <perlmodstyle>

Perl is a lot like C, which makes C programmers wonder where the heck <i>strlen()</i> got off to. Some of the <b>most noticable things</b> that must be overcome before Perl will accept your psuedo-C are: <br><br>
<b>Dollar signs in front of the scalars.</b> <br><br>
Yeah, I know. Its a <i>BASIC</i> thing that was perpetuated by <i>sh</i>. In Perl, they are called <i>sigils</i>. It does serve a purpose: by allowing you to create functions, I/O handles, arrays, hashes and scalars (which might contain references), you can write more obscure Perl. It also allows you to write expressions using <i>barewords</i>: <br><br>
<pre>
  $a = wussup;

</pre>
Barewords are unquoted strings other than function names. They get treated as strings for lack of anything else to do with them. That makes that expression the same as: <br><br>
<pre>
  $a = "wussup";

</pre>
Not quoting string literals is considered bad style in all but one case: hash table indices. Other uses are dissallowed when <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?UseStrict">UseStrict</a> is in effect. <br><br>
Variables can be introduced at any time, including leaf nodes on complex data structures built out of references. The sigils tell Perl what we're working with. <i>@foo = function();</i> tells <i>perl</i> that you want a list of things, while <i>$foo = function();</i> asks for only one. The situation is similar when fetching the value from variables.  <br><br>
<b>strlen() and sizeof()</b> <br><br>
<i>length()</i> serves both strings and arrays.  <br><br>
<b>Command Line Arguments</b> <br><br>
There is no specific function which is called when a Perl program is run. Instead, Perl runs the code from top to bottom, executing whatever it finds, including subroutine definitions. Therefore there is no function to pass arguments to. <i>@ARGV</i> has been selected for this purpose. Use <i>$ARGV[0]</i> to get at the first element, <i>$ARGV[1]</i> to get at the second, and so on. Note that the sigil in front of the variable changes depending on what you want back from it, not how it is actually declared. Specifically, the first element of <i>@ARGV</i> is a scalar, so we use the scalar sigil to fetch it: <i>$ARGV[0]</i>. <br><br>
<b>Comments</b> <br><br>
Comments begin with the hash symbol (or number sign, or pound sign, for you brits) and end at the end of the line: <br><br>
<pre>
  # this is a comment
  $a = 10; # and so is this


</pre>
Block quotes are attainable using the POD syntax documented in <a href="#PerlDoc">PerlDoc</a>. Comments quoted this way will become part of the documentation of the module or program, much like how <i>javadoc</i> processes comments into documentation. It is advisable to use this syntax before functions, perticularly publicly accessable ones, to explain what the function does, why, and what it requires to  do so. <br><br>
<b>Environment</b> <br><br>
Perl tells you about your environment in intimate detail. It is up to you to write portable code. Code that is oblivious to the system it is running on is an ideal, but is an impossible to acheive one in many cases. When workarounds are needed, you aren't restricted from performing them. See the perloc for Config, but as an example: <br><br>
<pre>
  # CGI.pm does this to learn about local linefeed insanity:
  $OS = $Config::Config{'osname'};

</pre>
Environment variables are included, of course. They are contained in the Perl hash, <i>%ENV</i>. For example: <br><br>
<pre>
  print "Search path: ", $ENV{PATH}, "\n";

</pre>
<b>Functions Without Parentheses</b> <br><br>
It is typical to see expressions in Perl not unlike: <br><br>
<pre>
  my @files = grep { $_ !~ m/^\./ } sort readdir $fh;

</pre>
This might lead one to believe that parentheses aren't used for function arguments and curly braces some how take their place. This might be partially true. Many functions expect a list of things, and many functions return lists of things. In this example, <i>readdir()</i> is returning a list to <i>sort()</i>; <i>sort()</i> is sorting that and sending it through <i>grep()</i>; grep has a strange little block after it. This is a block of code that will be run each item in the list as a test for inclusion. <i>sort()</i> and <i>map()</i> are two other functions that accept such an code block. The block is purely optional. Since all of our lists are implicitly created and implicitly passed around, we don't ever really need to group things using parenthesis. That doesn't mean we can't: <br><br>
<pre>
  my @files = get_file_list($ENV{'HOME'}, '.', `pwd`);

</pre>
Having optional parentheses does create a certain amount of confusion. People are often tempted to write expressions like: <br><br>
<pre>
  print (32/8)+10; # this prints "4"

</pre>
The space after <i>print()</i> means nothing. It still attaches itself to the single argument, 32/8. What probably meant is: <br><br>
<pre>
  print((32/8)+10); # this prints "14"

</pre>
The && operator also causes problems when parenthesis aren't used on lists of numbers. The && operating will work on the last thing in the list, rather than the return value of the function: <br><br>
<pre>
  sprintf "The number is: %d\n", 0 && return; # this won't return

</pre>
The obvious thing to do is introduce parenthesis, but you don't have to - Perl provides the <i>and</i> and <i>or</i> operators, which have very low precedence: <br><br>
<pre>
  sprintf "The number is: %d\n", 0 and return; # this will return

</pre>
Readability can suffer, but not having to match up parentheses all of the time saves a lot of bouncing around in the code. In case of doubt, use the parentheses. <br><br>
<b>$foo[$i] Doesn't Subscript Strings</b> <br><br>
<i>$foo[$i]</i> would return the <i>$i</i>th element of <i>@foo</i>. Perl doesn't consider <i>$foo</i> to be any sort of an array at all. When hand converting C code to Perl, this is a real pain, because it requires so much typing and occurs so often. The solution is: <br><br>
<pre>
  substr($foo, $i, 1); 

</pre>
This will tell Perl that we want a string of 1 element starting at the <i>$i</i>th element of <i>$foo</i>.  Since strings aren't arrays of characters, this returns a string of one character. Use <i>ord()</i> and <i>chr()</i> to convert between ASCII values and strings of one character. <br><br>
<b>Global, Local, and Lexical Variables</b> <br><br>
In C, all variables are either global, visible to the source code file but otherwise global, visible to only the function they were defined <i>static</i> in, or else allocated on the stack as an "automatic variable".  <br><br>
<ul><li> Global: Variables not declared but just used also have the scope of the entire file, as do variables declared <i>local</i> at the top of the file (unless the package is changed, which is a special case). These values can be accessed from anywhere in the program using special syntax.
<li> Private to the file: variables declared <i>my</i> at the top of the file are visible only in that file. This is similar to declaring a variable <i>static</i> outside of a function in C.
<li> Static variables inside functions: This isn't officially supported as an atomic feature, but is fairly easy to do in a couple of steps. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LexicalsMakeSense">LexicalsMakeSense</a>.
<li> Automatic variables: <i>my</i> variables declared inside of a function serve the same purpose, but many others. A neat trick combines the automatic allocation of automatic variables with the persistance of static variables. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LexicalsMakeSense">LexicalsMakeSense</a>.
</ul><br><br>
<b>Module Library</b> <br><br>
At compile time, a local repository for modules is established. This is like /usr/include, except it contains both code and definitions. Perl defaults to putting it in /usr/local/lib/perl5, but Linux distros like to move it up to /usr/lib/perl5. Poking through there and running  <i>perldoc</i> on each item yields thrilling insights into Perl. Much of what is apparently implemented in core is just modules that are used on demand. For instance, the pragmas like <i>use strict</i> are implemented mostly in terms of small modules. Downloading and installing modules from CPAN expands this collection, though in a subdirectory: /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl. You may also wish to add your own homebrew modules under there. <br><br>
<b>No Preprocessor</b> <br><br>
There is an interface to cpp available as a <i>source filter</i>, but its something you have to go and install. See the XXX module on CPAN. <br><br>
A common trick when writing modules that are used frequently is defering compilation of parts of code until they are first used. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AutoSplit">AutoSplit</a> for more information.  Constants can be established using this little trick: <br><br>
<pre>
  *pi = \3.14159; # I'm not a math geek

</pre>
This uses typeglobs, an obscure feature of Perl. Typeglobs define file-global variables by holding references to scalars, hashes, arrays, and so forth. We're storing a reference to a number directly, rather than a variable. This prevents accidential modification later on. <pre>
  
</pre>
You can also read in Perl code that defines variables using the <i>require</i> statement. <br><br>
<b>Primitive Data Types</b> <br><br>
As mentioned, there is no character datatype. Scalars, Arrays, Hashes, Globs, File handles, Directory handles and References (a type of scalar value) are the basic datatypes. Complex datatypes can be built from these (unlike in Perl 4). References can include object references, regular expression references, code references, references to other primitive datatypes, and many other things.  <br><br>
Reference types are pass-by-value. No copies are made of the objects they refer to when the reference is copy or passed to a subroutine. However, Perl tracks references, and the thing being refered to won't go away while anyone can see it. Perl objects are polite and only sneak off when no one is looking unless asked to garrote themselves. <br><br>
Scalars are floating point values, integers, strings, or refrences as needed. During the life of a scalar, it will typically bounce back and forth between being a string and a numeric value. In fact, Perl caches the numeric representation of strings containg numbers. For speed, Perl can be told not to use floating point representations: say <i>use int;</i> at the top of your file. <br><br>
Functions take exactly one kind of argument: an array. Each member of the array can  have its own value. In fact, a function may receive an array of exactly one thing: an array reference. Perl creates arrays on the fly like so: <br><br>
<pre>
  @array = (1, 2, 3, 'hi');

</pre>
However, arrays that aren't passed by reference get copied. That means: <br><br>
<pre>
  function(9, 10, @array);

</pre>
...//function()// shouldn't expect to get a reference to @array. Instead, everything inside of  array will be copied onto the end of <i>function()</i>'s argument list, making it equivilent to  saying: <br><br>
<pre>
  function(9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 'hi');

</pre>
Since so many of Perl's built in functions work on plain old flat lists, and it is easy to compose lists from many sources to feed to a function, this is officially considered a feature. <br><br>
While the behavior is to pass-by-value, Perl optimizes away the duplication of the scalar values until the point that you read the arguments, if you read them. This is a technicality, and probably won't affect you. This clause only exists to silence technical knit-pickers. <br><br>
<b>Checking Objects For Equality</b> <br><br>
Good luck. If you have a reference, you need intimate knowledge of it to compare it value-for-value to a like reference. When writing your own objects, using an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?EqualsInterface">EqualsInterface</a> is highly recommended. <br><br>
<b>Perl has no Pointers... Well...</b> <br><br>
Perl does automatic array expansion, <i>autovivication</i> (creation on demand) of  elements in datastructures and variables, and lots of other fun <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DynamicLanguage">DynamicLanguage</a> stuff. If you really want to blow a smoking hole through your footsies, there is a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PeekPoke">PeekPoke</a> module on CPAN. Perl grows arrays as needed. Attempting to access a negitive array element addresses the array relative the end. <br><br>
<b>undef</b> <br><br>
The default value for variables is <i>undef</i>, like null. With warnings on, enabled by <i>use warnings</i> or passing perl the <i>-w</i> switch, attempts to read values from variables that have not yet had a value assigned results in a warning. You yourself can mark a variable as having no value: <br><br>
<pre>
  use warnings;
  my $sum = 0;
  my @prices = (10.95, 15.95, 5.95, 25.95, 45.95);
  foreach my $price (@prices) {
    $sum += $price;
  }
  print "$sum was yesterdays price. It isn't valid anymore. Sorry! Offer expired!\n";
  $sum = undef;
  print "The total for this order is: $sum\n"; # this gives an error message

</pre>
The text of the error was "Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at - line 9.". <br><br>
<pre>
  if(undef == 0) { print "True\n"; }

  my $a = undef;
  if($a == 0) { print "True\n"; }

</pre>
Logically, undef == 0. Many built in functions return a number on success and <i>undef</i> on failure: 0 is a possible success return value. So is the null string, <i>''</i>. Rather than testing for truth, you must test for definidness: <br><br>
<pre>
  if(defined my $line = &lt;>) {
    # deal with more frivelous user demands
  }
  # user has shut up now and hit Control-D or closed the connection

</pre>
<i>defined()</i> returns true if its argument is defined and false if its argument is in fact not. <br><br>
To restate, <i>0</i> is a defined value, as is <i>10</i>, <i>"Hello"</i>, and so forth. Only no value and <i>undef</i> itself test positive in <i>defined()</i>. <br><br>
<li> References <br><br>
Perl implements reference counting. Reference counting is fast, saves the bother of manually having to allocate and free memory (and other resources if object destructors are used).  Garbage collection correctly copes with the situation where two structures reference each other. With reference counts, each structure has a reference on it, so it is never freed, even when the two structure aren't visible from anywhere else: <br><br>
<pre>
  do {
    my $a = [1, 2, 3];
    my $b = [4, 5, 6];
    $a->[4] = $b;
    $b->[4] = $a; # uh oh!
  }
  # $a and $b still live on, even though they are out of scope

</pre>
You might not notice if you accidently do a few of these babies in code that runs only briefly then exits, like a CGI script. This can leak memory (allocate memory never to be freed) and ultimately expend all of the available resources on a long-running application, like a daemon. See <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DaemonProcess">DaemonProcess</a>. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ScalarUtils">ScalarUtils</a> defines a <i>weaken()</i> function for creating weak references - an effective way of avoiding leaks. <br><br>
<b>Arrays</b> <br><br>
Arrays are minipulated by value or by reference: <br><br>
<pre>
  int stuff[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};    /* an array in C, by reference */
  my $stuff   = [1, 2, 3, 4];     # an array reference in Perl 
  my @stuff   = (1, 2, 3, 4);     # an array in Perl

</pre>
On the second line, the <a href="#footnote47">[47]</a> constructs a reference to a list, which then gets stored in $stuff. $stuff itself is not a reference, but merely a SCALAR that has an array reference stored into it. Remember, there is no pointer/reference type in Perl. <br><br>
If manipulated by reference, only information about where to find the array is passed around, and only one copy of the actual array exists that is shared by everyone who knows where to find it. By value, the entire array is duplicated every time it is passed anywhere, giving each function (internal or external) its own private copy to play with. One exception to that rule is the <i>foreach()</i> operator.  <br><br>
<i>foreach()</i> uses heavy magic to make each each element it iterates over merely an alias into the array. This is a performance optimization and a useful feature. These two code examples do the same thing: <br><br>
<pre>
  @ar = map { $_++} @ar;
  foreach my $i (@ar) { $i++ } # optionally, for means the same thing as foreach

</pre>
For performance, Perl programmers sometimes tell Perl to pre-grow arrays, instead of letting Perl do it on demand: <br><br>
<pre>
  @ar = 1000; # allocate 1000 slots

</pre>
Arrays can be multidimentional. C arrays allocated thus: <br><br>
<pre>
  char message[10][255];    /* 10 messages of 255 characters each */

</pre>
...are entirely preallocated, and have no lookup table: since each message is of fixed size, C need only look for the first one at offset 0, the next one at offset 255, the next at offset 510, and so on. This is <b>not</b> how Perl arrays work. Arrays allocated like: <br><br>
<pre>
  char *message[];           /* I don't know how many messages or how long it might be */

</pre>
...is a much a much closer faximile. A pointer holds the address that points to a row of characters in memory. In the same way, a Perl array can list references to other arrays. The <i>-></i> operator dereferences reference types of various type. This example creates a reference (pointer) to an array, and starts populating it with references to other arrays: <br><br>
<pre>
  my $arrayRef = [];
  $arrayRef->[0] = [1, 2, 3];
  $arrayRef->[1] = [4, 5, 6];
  $arrayRef->[2] = [7, 8, 9];

  print $arrayRef->[1]->[1], "\n";  # prints 5, right in the middle, just like Hollywood Squares

</pre>
Because it is unambigious, Perl accepts as a short hand this syntax for indicing multidimentional arrays: <br><br>
<pre>
  print $arrayRef->[1][1], "\n"; # like above

</pre>
Note that the first <i>-></i> is still required to distinguish between the reference <i>$arrayRef</i> and the array <i>@arrayRef</i>. In some languages, arrays are objects. Perl is not one of them. In other languages, arrays are never objects. Perl is not one of them either. In Perl, arrays are <i>sometimes</i> objects. When they are objects, they do not a provide a standard, generic API for minipulating arrays, but rather provide an API cooked up off the cuff by the creator of the object. This means that the API is more likely to be useful but less likely to be consistent. <br><br>
<b>Strings</b> <br><br>
Strings in Perl are <i>not</i> null-terminated arrays of characters as they are in C, nor are they necissarily an instance of some class, though a string-reference could be.  They also aren't references, but it is possible and useful to make and use string references. The methods <i>substr()</i>, <i>index()</i>, <i>sprintf()</i>, and <i>length()</i> come to mind for being useful to work on strings. There are many more XXX. Strings in Perl, like everything else in Perl not marked otherwise, are binary safe. Arbitrary binary data may be stored in them, including the null byte. utf8 strings are available as well - <i>use utf8</i> at the top of your code for that, and see <i>perldoc utf8</i>. <br><br>
<li> Operators <br><br>
Perl supports too many operators to list in a document like this. The list of Perl operators is listed in a much longer documented, available from <i>perldoc perlop</i>. Many of the C operators are available. Most critically, though: <br><br>
<pre>
   gt lt eq ne cmp       # like >, &lt;, ==, !=, &lt;=>, but for strings: compares lexically or literally

   # this prints true - you probably want the "eq" operator:
   if("hello" == "world") { print "true\n"; }  

   ->  # dereference any reference type. the exact syntax depends on the reference:

   $a->[0]      # dereference an array ref
   $a->{'hi'}   # dereference a hash ref
   $a->blurgh() # dereference an object reference

</pre>
It is not uncommon to mix and match them in one statement, if you know the datatypes of everything: <br><br>
<pre>
   $a->[0]->{'hi'}->blurgh();

</pre>
If you have trouble with this, rethink what returns what reference types. This assumes that you have a scalar, <i>$a</i>, that is an array reference. That array  holds a list of references to hashes (hash references). Those hashes each contain references to objects. Actually, that is too broad of a statement - Perl is dynamically typed, but this paragraph assumes that you've been consistent with your datastructure. <br><br>
<b>if/elsif/else statements</b> <br><br>
In Perl, the case where an else has another if after it has its own keyword. This is due to the bracketing rules: each <i>if</i> statement must have brackets around its body. <br><br>
<pre>
  if($foo == 1) {
    # do something
  } elsif($foo == 2) {
    # do something else
  } else {
    # complain and do nothing
  }

</pre>
<b>Forward References</b> <br><br>
Perl requires <i>my</i> variables to be declared before they are used. Nothing else is subject to this restriction. If your code calls a method, Perl holds it in good faith that that method will be defined before it is used. <i>use</i> and <i>BEGIN { }</i> disrupt the  orderly pattern of parsing then running: Perl stops compiling at sight of either of those, immediately compiles and executes the module in the case of <i>use</i> or immediately  runs the code in the <i>BEGIN { }</i> block, then resumes parsing where it left off. <br><br>
<b>No Structures or Unions, no Typedef</b> <br><br>
Perl does not support Structures or Unions, expecting you to construct an object, no matter how trivial, to accomplish this. Typedef does not exist: once again, use objects. Often an <a href="#AbstractFactory">AbstractFactory</a> will accomplish the same thing. <br><br>

An "Object" is a little, or not so little, program that has its own functions (called "methods") and its own data. Objects are a kind of data, so one object can contain another object, using a variable. This program-in-a-variable seems to hide from the world in its little shell, only communicating through method's return values. <br><br>
In Perl 5, the -> is an operator that expects the thing on the left ($outside) to contain the thing on the right (getSky()). Objects are one of many reference types. Generally speaking, the arrow operator takes a reference datatype on the left ($outside), and attempts to fetch a value from it. The way a value is fetched from an object is by calling a method in it, possibly passing that method arguments. Other reference types are similar but slightly different:  <br><br>
Fetching data from an object reference: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $obj->getColor();

</pre>
Fetching data from a reference to a subroutine: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $colorSubroutine->();

</pre>
Fetching data from a reference to a hash: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $stuff->{'color'};

</pre>
Fetching data from an array reference: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $colors->[37];

</pre>
Fetching data from a sca lar reference: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $$colorPointer;

</pre>
Fetching data from a reference to a filehandle: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = &lt;$colorFile>; 

</pre>
It's up to you to use a reference the correct way. It may help to use paper to make a graph of what contains what. If you find things empty that you know you stored data in, or perl is telling you you can't use one reference type as another, you've gotten confused at some point. Perl 5 references are second only to regular expressions in creating "line noise" code. It's possible to have an array reference which contains hash references which contain object references. The secret is to remember which contains what, and request them in the correct order: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $anArray->[42]->{'thatOne'}->getColor();

</pre>
Often, calling a method in an object will return a new object. Sometimes you'll find yourself using, but not saving, intermediate objects: <br><br>
<pre>
  $color = $outside->getSky()->getColor();

</pre>
"Programming Perl", O'Reilly Press, offers a complete rundown on using references, creating them, creating objects, and more. It is a thourogh tour of the how and why of Perl. That knowledge isn't critical to understand this book, but on the other hand, we don't replicate that information here, either. <br><br>
<br><br> <a name="PerlOoNutsAndBolts"><h2>PerlOoNutsAndBolts</h2><br> <br><br>
<pre>
  package Man;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $me = { };
    bless $me, $type;
  }

  return 1;

</pre>
An object is an instance of a class. If you're a biology major, an object is a  phenotype and a class is a genotype. A class is a prototype, and an object came  off of an assembly line. For Perl purposes, "class",  "package", and "type" are  interchangeable. A package is the prototype for making objects. It gives the  instructions on how to make a new object, and it defines how it will work once  its made. While the package is the form a class takes, the variable that you  bless is the core of the object. Two things happen: bless() mucks with the  variable, recording the name of the package that it is now part of, so attempts  to call methods in it in the future will be routed back to the package it was  blessed in. Also, it contains all of the information specific to particular  instance of the class. "Instance" is OO jargon that translates to "an object made  from a certain package". $me is assigned to { }, which when used as a value  creates a reference to a hash. Thus, $me becomes a hash reference. The basic  datatype our object will store data in is going to be a hash, in this case. My  variables are intimately tied to objects in Perl, since the package that  implements the objects has to handle each and every object it creates, and not  confuse their data with each other. My variables are not only private to particular  method they are defined in, but they aren't even visible from outside that method.  We'll encounter more useful magic of the "my" variable later. In OO lingo, the  function in a package that sets up a new object, typically named new(), is called  the "constructor". <br><br>
This code fragment would be placed alone in a file named "Man.pm". The return  statement is required so that Perl knows that the class loaded successfully. <br><br>
<pre>
  use Man;
  $obj = Man->new();

</pre>
This fragment calls the new() method in the Man (if it isn't defined, inheritance  kicks in and new() is searched for). Note that 'Man' isn't actually an object  reference. Its just a bareword. Perl takes it as a class name when used like this.  Another way to say the same thing, which resembles other OO languages more closely, is: <br><br>
<pre>
  use Man;
  $obj = new Man;

</pre>
In either case, the string literal 'Man' is passed to the new() method. This  is important, since the new() method doesn't always know what kind of object its  making. This happens when one package inherits another. If the new() made assumptions  about what kind of objects it was making, it couldn't be trusted to help make  objects for a subtype of itself.  The creating of the object is done by the perl  built-in bless. The "use" statement tells Perl to seek out the module and load  it in. In order to call new() in it, we're going to need to have it already loaded. <br><br>
Nothing is special about the new() method. It is merely convention to use new()  as the function in the package that creates a new Object based on itself. It  can be considered the default way to create a new object of a type, though  there are certainly times when a different method will return an object,  possibly of a completely different type. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>;

  @ISA = ('Man');

  sub getTimeOfDay {
    my $me = shift;
    unless(caller->isa(__PACKAGE__)) {
      die "Not for you, buddy!";
    }
    return scalar localtime(time());
  }

  return 1;

</pre>
When we create an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>, The "$me" that we get was actually created  in Man. Since <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a> doesn't define a new() method, Perl examines the  @ISA array to decide what else we are. Our more primitive being may know how to  cope with this situation. In this case, new() is called in Man with the argument  'InvestmentBanker'. It happily returns one. When parents give birth to investment  bankers, they usually don't know right away. They do know that they are giving  birth to a person. <u></u>PACKAGE__ can always be used to retrieve the name of the  current package, which is "main" by default, or whatever you've set it to using  the "package" statement. You could use a string here that is set to the same  thing that you set the package to, but this lets you set it one place and never  have to spell it correctly again. The caller() method examines the caller stack.  The caller stack keeps track of where we are in the program, especially where  we need to return to as each function or method finishes. In this case, we're  concerned with the object that called our method. In scalar context, caller()  returns a package name. We're using that package name as if it were an object,  just like we did above with Man->new(). This doesn't invoke a specific instance  of the package, but rather goes directly to the package. isa() is a method  defined in the UNIVERSAL package that searches through the inheritance tree for  you, as defined by which classes list which other classes in their @ISA arrays.  In this example, we want to know if the class that called us has an "is a"  relationship (that is, either actually is, or inherits from) our class, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>.  <br><br>
<pre>
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>;
  my $banker = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>;
  print $banker->getTimeOfDay();

</pre>
If you run this code from a separate file, you'll get a message similar to: <br><br>
Not for you, buddy! at <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>.pm line 12. <br><br>
If we change the same code to read: <br><br>
<pre>
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>;
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WallStreetTrader">WallStreetTrader</a>;
  @ISA = ('InvestmentBanker');
  my $banker = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>;
  print $banker->getTimeOfDay();

</pre>
Then, we get a more friendly answer. Investment Bankers aren't bad people, they're  just very, very busy. Sometimes you have to be careful with whom you speak, for  reasons of security. This behavior, where we consider the package of the code  calling us, is similar to the behavior of the Java "protected" keyword. This is  part of the idea of "encapsulation", and becomes extremely useful when you want  your own packages to have special access to other instances of themselves. This  happens when you need to make your packages work closely together in ways aren't  safe for other people to assume they can, such as in ways that you might change  in the future, or ways that would by-pass the OO nature of your object if just  anyone could use it. It should be noted that some languages check your program  at compile time, before it runs, to make sure you aren't trying to access something  protected in another class. Perl 5 doesn't. <br><br>
Note that in this example, we're setting up a package, but we don't bother to  make a new instance of it and turn it into an object. This is okay sometimes,  like for testing and things that will only run once, and is strictly the norm  for the main part of the program that executes before any objects are created.  However, be careful not to do this when you're preventing code from inheriting  it, or preventing other people from using the package to make objects when it  would be useful. <br><br>
Our <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WallStreetTrader">WallStreetTrader</a> is getting bored. Lets give some meaning to his life. <br><br>
<pre>
  package <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $me = {};
    bless $me, $type;
  }

  sub play {
    my $me = shift;
    my $investor = shift; $investor->isa('InvestmentBanker') or die;
    my $stock = shift; $stock->isa('Stock') or die;
    my $amount = shift;
    $stock->set_quantity($amount);
    $me->{$investor}={$stock};
  }

  package Stock;

  sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $me = {@_};
    bless $me, type;
  }   

  foreach my $i (qw(name price quantity)) {
    my $field = $i;
    *{"get_$field"} = sub {
      my $me = shift;
      return $me->{$field};
    };
    *{"set_$field"} = sub {
      my $me = shift;
      @_ or die "not enough arguments to set_$field, stopped";
      $me->{$field} = shift;
      return 1;
     };
  }

</pre>
Put Stock in a file named Stock.pm and <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a> in a file named <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>.pm. Then, in a separate file, run this code: <br><br>
<pre>
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WallStreetTrader">WallStreetTrader</a>;
  use <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>;
  use Stock;

  $trader = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WallStreetTrader">WallStreetTrader</a>;
  $stock = new Stock(name=>'ILL', price=>5.45);
  $wallstreet = new <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>;
  $wallstreet->play($trader, $stock, 10000);

</pre>
The play() method in <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>.pm  accepts a reference to an object made  from itself, as its first argument. This is typical of methods. The package  has the code, but the object has the data. We have to look inside of the object  ($me) to get at the data of the object. Other OO languages implicitly take this  first argument, often called "this". Perl 5 requires you to manually accept this  argument. That isn't all, though. The method is looking for two more arguments:  an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a> object, and a Stock object. We ask the values we receive if  they are of the type we expect (or if they inherit from those types). This is  called "type safety" in OO lingo. In Perl, we process our arguments manually,  and we enforce type safety manually. Thankfully, its rather painless. Should  we receive something other than an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a> or a Stock, we complain  immediately and loudly. Some languages check this when the code is compiled,  before the program is ever run. Perl 5 does so at runtime.  <br><br>
Once we know we have good data, we store the amount of stock purchased inside the Stock object, and we keep a reference to the Stock object. The <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a> object is actually updated to contain the Stock object. This would be called a "has a" relationship. <br><br>
The constructor in Stock.pm is a little bit different than the ones we've seen so far. $me is assigned to {@_} instead of { }. This takes the arguments as a hash, and turns them into a hash reference. This way, the starting values of instances variables can be defined when the object is created. "Instance variables" are values associated with a particular object, and are what makes an object unique among other objects of the same type. <br><br>
The foreach loop in Stock.pm bares some explanation. It loops over a list of field names in the object. "Field names" is another phrase for "instance variables". For each field in the object, we want to create a method that can fetch the value, and a method that can set its value. These are called "accessors", because they are used to access field values in an object. Since accessors have a way of all looking alike, and since OO code tends to have a lot of accessors, its a very nice thing that Perl lets you create functions on the fly, which is exactly what we are doing. We have an example get_ function, and an example set_ function, to get and set fields. The only thing missing from the example code is the exact names of the fields to get and set. This is stored in the variable $field, and assigned in turn each value from a list. Twice each pass in the loop, we generate an accessor name based on the field name, and we assign that to an anonymous subroutine, courtesy of sub { }. Sub returns a code reference, which gets stored in the code slot of the glob, which gives a name to the previously anonymous code block. Since $field is a lexical variable, and since we make a new $field each loop with my, the code reference that we are naming each are attached to their very own private copy of the $field variable, completely intact with the name of the field the accessor is supposed to access. Since we haven't hard-coded that value into the code, this information will definitely come in handy when we go to use the accessors we are producing.  This was the other magical thing about my variables I mentioned previously. In the set_ methods we generate, we make sure that there is an argument for us to actually store. If not, we complain. <br><br>
Any time you talk about generating code on the fly and lexical variables in the same sentance, you're talking about lambdas. Lambdas are a LISP influence in Perl. The basic idea is that code and data are one. Code can hang on to data. That data can be more code. That data can be code from somewhere else, that is hanging onto different data. This is a slippery idea because of its scope, but its utter simplicity has caused many computer programmers to jump out of the tub and run down the street unclothe screaming "Eureka!". Code and data being one and the same amounts to a compiler built into the language, sort of like "eval", except much cleaner and more efficient for most purposes. <br><br>
If you wanted to avoid such hairy topics for now, you would need to repeat the same sequence of code three times, making only slight changes each times. The first of the three accessors would look like: <br><br>
<pre>
  sub get_name {
    my $me = shift;
    return $me->{'name'};
  };

  sub set_name {
    my $me = shift;
    @_ or die "not enough arguments to set_name, stopped";
    $me->{'name'} = shift;
    return 1;
  };

</pre>
Stock.pm is an example of data encapsulation, and acts as nothing more than a simple container for information. Future version of Stock.pm could guard data closely, or perform other operations on it. Because the accessors are code, instead of just variables, it gives us the precious chance to do some fudging: for instance, if the name of the Stock were removed, to be replaced with 'companyName' and 'tickerSymbol', we could redefine get_name() to return the tickerSymbol and companyName, combined into one string. set_name() could perhaps change companyName, but call warn() to warn the programmer that a legacy method was being called, and that she needs to use an updated accessor now. <br><br>
Not illustrated in the code is polymorphism: an example would be to send a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WallStreetTrader">WallStreetTrader</a> to the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a>'s invest() method. Since a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?WallStreetTrader">WallStreetTrader</a> is a kind of <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>, and all the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a> wants is an <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?InvestmentBanker">InvestmentBanker</a>, this is perfectly okay. As far as the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?TradingFloor">TradingFloor</a> is concerned, even though they may behave a little bit differently, it can trust either of them to do the duties it will ask of them. <br><br>

This uses a "pragma" module to do the same thing as assign to @ISA, but with a cleaner syntax. <br><br>
<pre>
  ::

</pre>
::, at its most basic level, tells Perl where to look for a module: <br><br>
use <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CGI/">CGI</a>::<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?module=CGI::Carp">Carp</a>; <br><br>
Perl always searches @PATH looking for modules, which usually includes the current directory.  However, module names with :: in them are in a subdirectory of a directory in the path. You can nest as deeply as you wish <a href="#footnote48">[48]</a>. Carp.pm would be in a directory named "CGI" off of a directory listed in @PATH. This is ideal for utility classes, data container classes, and other classes related to a more central class. "CGI::Carp" is only useful to CGI applications. "Carp" is the real module, while "CGI::Carp" is only a wrapper to it for CGI applications. <br><br>

Exploring, and writing about Design Patterns as they apply to Perl. Yes, thats  right, Perl. Everyone knows that Perl programmers lack discipline and bondage.  Perl does offer many <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ObjectOriented">ObjectOriented</a> features, as long as you aren't looking for  compile time checking. Don't get me wrong - Java is great. I highly recommend  Java for large or collaborative development efforts. Java addresses most  shortcomings of C++, and creates a consistent, likeable language. Perl won't go  away, despite many people's sincere desires, so I'm attempting to retrofit the  bondage beating stick with a carrot. If Design Patterns can exploit the Perl  programmer's natural love of fun and neat tricks, we may be able to convert  some of the unwashed masses - right? Having OO, lambdas, lexical scoping, tied  data, operator overloading, symbol table manipulation, runtime inheritance tree  manipulation, multiple inheritance, weak typing, and access to the bytecode tree  certainly makes for adventures to be had. I apologize - I know that adventuring  can be fun, rescuing people who got themselves up a creek isn't. Documenting  useful interaction between these diverse ideas is uncharted territory, perhaps  akin to a polar region, waiting to be explored. <br><br>
Your feedback is strongly encouraged. I want to know: <li> What you like <li> What you dislike <li> What you don't understand <li> What you do understand <li> What I forgot to explain <li> What I've explained too many times <li> Which explaination you liked better of the lot ;) <br><br>

The introduction exists to try to sell you this book. To do this, it tries to convince you there is a problem, and that this book contains the solution. Any publishers book proposal form revolves around this.  After submitting a few dozen of those, answering the numerous questions with intricate detail, you get the distinct impression that the only part of the book that matters is the introduction.  Take for instance the proposals at:  <li> <a href="http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=105">http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=105</a>  <li> <a href="http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=57">http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=57</a>  <li> <a href="http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=58">http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=58</a>  <li> <a href="http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=59">http://www.slowass.net/phaedrus/todospool.pl?mesgid=59</a>  <br><br>
These also serve as exmaples of book proposals that are sure to be completely ignored. <br><br>
I've read more than a few new books recently with great introductions and lackluster content. You wouldn't be holding this on your hands or screen unless you had an inkling what a <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DesignPattern">DesignPattern</a> is, or already felt the need, so my advise is skip it. In a book about Perl, I personally would want to see lots of Perl, and I bet you feel the same way.  <br><br>
Goals: <br><br>
<li> Lexicon <li> Cookbook style OO code <li> Hardcore OOD/A text <li> API documentation <br><br>
To understand the larger structures, you must understand the pressures from the larger structures as well as the semantics of the smaller structures. Semantics and funny syntaxii cause more confusion. Previously, those came first to get them out of the way. The patterns came next, and are approximately on the scale of the <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?GangOfPatterns">GangOfPatterns</a> in scope. Then we talk about program features, each touching on  several finer-grained patterns. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ApplicationTypes">ApplicationTypes</a> use collections of features - we these come next. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?ConceptsCrossReference">ConceptsCrossReference</a> and <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?AntiPatterns">AntiPatterns</a> are essentially redundant, and everything beyond them is for reference. <br><br>

I can't stop writing introductions! I think I'm still trying to rationalize this to myself, or sound it out in my head, or gauge my writing style to see if it has improved in the past few months.  <br><br>

Scott Walters is just another Perl hacker who had to rescue one too many doomed  projects and got to thinking about why some code is really truly awful. Most of  this awful code masquerade as Object Oriented. I can remember the exact moment -  I was working on some Java that did nothing like what the comments said or the  code suggested, when I realized that it was accepting arguments and storing them  back into the same global variables, unmodified, that they were passed from. I  thought back to a certain Perl program that kept its entire state in a hash,  joined repeatedly with multiple separators, and saved it to disc to pass it between  functions. Then, I said to myself, "This world needs whistle blowers to stop the  damage bad code does". Actually, I said to myself, "I wonder in which ways my  code is truly awful, beyond the ways in which I already know it to be truly awful?"  <br><br>
Thats a complete lie. Perhaps it goes back to 1997, when I was living in Sedona, Arizona, working for a little startup company. One of the people involved in the project, Robert Rhodes (a book of whose I still need to return), made a clear effort to make sure that OO methods were to be used for the work I did there. Normally in this situation, glazing over at the eyes is all I need do. In this case, a clear expectation was being set for me, and I had to unset it. I formulated a defense: Object Oriented programming is just one paradigm. New paradigms come about because of shortcomings of earlier paradigms, not because earlier ones are fundamentally invalid. Slavish adherance to a paradigm is no substitute for knowledge, skill, or artistry. Further, there were plenty of other paradigms: <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LambdaProgramming">LambdaProgramming</a>, <a href="#FunctionalProgramming">FunctionalProgramming</a>, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LiterateProgramming">LiterateProgramming</a>, and their ideas: goal-directed evaluation, systems of constraints, and lots of other very powerful concepts. I'd like to tell you that I've been made an OO convert. If that were true, my bank account would nothing resemble its current state. Instead, I decided the only way anyone would mistakenly download a text by me is if I smeared "Object Oriented" all over it. Actually, that isn't true. I decided to incorporate other ideas into the Object Oriented paradigm.  <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DesignPatterns">DesignPatterns</a> was my chance. <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?DesignPatterns">DesignPatterns</a> have been adopted by OO programming, but otherwise have no loyalty to OO.  <br><br>
Evil people always tell you their evil plans. I sure hope no one reads this sections. <br><br>
When you've hired a hundred trained chimpanzes to write all of your code, the first and last rule is: do not let the chimps have any fun or they will get no work done. Object Oriented programming has traditionally done exactly that. Taking away every option to exercise creativity including even minor design work assures that no fun will be had by the chimps. I'm here to score one for the chimps. If a job isn't engaging and challenging, the chimps loose interest, and you loose the best chimps. Unless you have bananas. <br><br>

GNU Free Documentation License 		   Version 1.1, March 2000 <br><br>
<pre>
 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


</pre>
0. PREAMBLE <br><br>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. <br><br>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. <br><br>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. <br><br>
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS <br><br>
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". <br><br>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. <br><br>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. <br><br>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. <br><br>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. <br><br>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque". <br><br>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?LaTeX">LaTeX</a> input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PostScript">PostScript</a>, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only. <br><br>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. <br><br>
2. VERBATIM COPYING <br><br>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. <br><br>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. <br><br>
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY <br><br>
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. <br><br>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. <br><br>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. <br><br>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. <br><br>
4. MODIFICATIONS <br><br>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: <br><br>
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct <pre>
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
</pre>
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities <pre>
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
</pre>
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the <pre>
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
</pre>
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications <pre>
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
</pre>
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice <pre>
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
</pre>
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections <pre>
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
</pre>
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to <pre>
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
</pre>
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for <pre>
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
</pre>
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", <pre>
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
</pre>
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, <pre>
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
</pre>
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section <pre>
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
</pre>
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" <pre>
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</pre>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. <br><br>
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. <br><br>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. <br><br>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. <br><br>
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS <br><br>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice. <br><br>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. <br><br>
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements." <br><br>
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS <br><br>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. <br><br>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. <br><br>
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS <br><br>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. <br><br>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate. <br><br>
8. TRANSLATION <br><br>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail. <br><br>
9. TERMINATION <br><br>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br><br>
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE <br><br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</a> <br><br>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. <br><br>
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents <br><br>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: <br><br>
<pre>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR   YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

</pre>
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts. <br><br>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software. <br><br>

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: "Interface" is much more trendy than the ailing "Application Programmer  Interface", or "API". Generally speaking, an interface is how you use something.  Just like any consumer appliance, modules should be used in very specific ways:  do not submerse in water. Do not use while driving. Do not paint over vents.  Do not insert fingers. Do not leave on "high" setting unattended. Not only do  programs use APIs to talk to the outside world, they use them internally to  connect parts. <br><br>
<a name="footnote2">2</a>: <i>bless</i> is the Perl keyword that associates a datastructure with a class, or package. <br><br>

<a name="footnote4">4</a>: Sarah L. Winchester, heir to the Winchester estate, began hearing voices telling her that when she stopped building the mansion, she would die. Franticly, she built a 160 room brick mansion, connecting halls, tunnels, foyers, closets and every other sort of space and passage everywhere she could connect them. <br><br>

<a name="footnote9">9</a>: A <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?CallBack">CallBack</a> allows behavior to be defined, not run immediately, but rather sent to another routine for its use. Perl's <i>sort { $a <=> $b } @list</i> uses this  idea, where the expression <i>{ $a <=> $b }</i> isn't executed immediately, but  rather defined for <i>sort</i>'s use. <br><br>
<a name="footnote10">10</a>: XXX the two XML parsers interfaces would present a good example <br><br>

<a name="footnote15">15</a>: Although they could have created a factory for producing objects with overloaded <i>eq</i> operators that return the correct package name and each possible memory address, attempting to use a brute force attack. Since memory addresses are fairly predictable between runs, this approach would be fairly effective. Again, Perl and Security don't really go together at the source code level.

<a name="footnote23">23</a>: XXX code! Example! <br><br>
<a name="footnote24">24</a>: Continuations, promised in Perl 6 but lacking in 5, allow each line of execution to have their own stack and not have to return all the way out in order to surrender the CPU - CPU management is still manual, but much easier, and the manual control comes with great power. <br><br>
